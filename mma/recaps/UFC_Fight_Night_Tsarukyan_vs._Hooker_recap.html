      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        The UFC's historic debut in Qatar delivered an action-packed night that perfectly balanced spectacular finishes with significant divisional implications. While the co-main event drew criticism for its lack of action, the card overall showcased why international events often produce more exciting fights than those held at the Apex facility.
        
        <br>
        <br>

        The evening was headlined by <strong>Arman Tsarukyan's</strong> dominant return, who solidified his position as the true number one contender in the lightweight division with a methodical ground assault that eventually led to a second-round submission victory over the always-game <strong>Dan Hooker</strong>. This performance after a 19-month layoff demonstrated why Tsarukyan deserves the next title shot in the crowded lightweight landscape.
        
        <br>
        <br>

        Further down the card, several prospects made significant statements about their future potential. <strong>Kyoji Horiguchi's</strong> spectacular return to the UFC saw him systematically break down <strong>Tagir Ulanbekov</strong> in a performance that reminded everyone why he was once considered among the sport's elite. <strong>Waldo Cortes-Acosta</strong> continued his impressive 2025 campaign with another first-round knockout, taking out <strong>Shamil Gaziev</strong> on just two days' notice in a display of sheer toughness and power.
        
        <br>
        <br>

        The event also featured several concerning moments, particularly <strong>Jack Hermansson's</strong> second brutal knockout in a short timeframe, raising serious questions about his fighting future. Similarly, the disappointing performances from highly-touted prospects like <strong>Saygid Izagakhmaev</strong> demonstrated that reputation alone doesn't guarantee UFC success.
        
        <br>
        <br>

        With multiple contenders emerging across weight classes and several fighters positioning themselves for title shots, UFC Qatar successfully blended entertainment with meaningful divisional movement, earning a solid 7.6 rating and proving that international fight nights can deliver PPV-level excitement.
        
        <br>
        <br>

      <h2 id="main-card">Main Card</h2>
      
      <div class="fight" id="arman-tsarukyan-vs-dan-hooker">
        <h3>Arman Tsarukyan vs. Dan Hooker</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Arm Triangle Choke at 3:34 Round 2 of 5, 8:34 Total</p>
        <p>
          This main event clash had significant implications for the lightweight division, with <strong>Arman Tsarukyan</strong> looking to solidify his position as the number one contender after being forced to pull out of a title shot earlier this year due to injury. Standing across from him was the always-game <strong>Dan Hooker</strong>, who was riding a three-fight win streak and looking to make one last run at UFC gold.

          <br>
          <br>

          From the opening bell, <strong>Tsarukyan</strong> implemented his gameplan perfectly, immediately shooting for takedowns and controlling <strong>Hooker</strong> against the cage. While <strong>Hooker</strong> showed moments of resistance, he had no answer for <strong>Tsarukyan's</strong> grappling prowess once the fight hit the mat. In the second round, <strong>Tsarukyan</strong> secured another takedown, advanced to mount, and smoothly transitioned to an arm triangle choke that forced <strong>Hooker</strong> to tap.

          <br>
          <br>

          This impressive performance after a 19-month layoff solidifies <strong>Tsarukyan</strong> as the rightful number one contender who should receive the next lightweight title shot. For <strong>Hooker</strong>, this loss likely ends his championship aspirations, but he remains a fan-friendly fighter who could still provide exciting matchups against other contenders in the division's upper echelon.

      <div class="fight" id="ian-machado-garry-vs-belal-muhammad">
        <h3>Ian Machado Garry vs. Belal Muhammad</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          The co-main event featured a pivotal welterweight matchup between former champion <strong>Belal Muhammad</strong> and rising contender <strong>Ian Machado Garry</strong>, with the winner positioning themselves for a potential title shot in the crowded division. Unfortunately, this highly anticipated bout failed to deliver the excitement fans were hoping for.

          <br>
          <br>

          From the opening round, <strong>Garry</strong> implemented a cautious gameplan, circling the octagon and evading <strong>Muhammad's</strong> attacks while landing occasional low kicks. The fight was marred by multiple eye pokes from <strong>Garry</strong>, including one particularly blatant instance that went unpunished. <strong>Muhammad</strong> struggled to close the distance effectively and was unable to secure the takedowns that might have changed the fight's dynamic.

          <br>
          <br>

          While <strong>Garry</strong> secured the clear decision victory, his conservative performance likely cost him an immediate title shot. His style of circling and avoiding engagement, while effective, doesn't create the highlight-reel moments or fan excitement that typically earns title opportunities. <strong>Muhammad</strong> now faces a difficult path back to contention, having lost two of his last three fights against top competition.

          <br>

      <div class="fight" id="volkan-oezdemir-vs-alonzo-menifield">
        <h3>Volkan Oezdemir vs. Alonzo Menifield</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Knee and Punches at 1:27 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>
          This light heavyweight bout pitted veteran <strong>Volkan Oezdemir</strong> against <strong>Alonzo Menifield</strong>, with both fighters looking to establish themselves in the upper tier of the division. <strong>Oezdemir</strong>, a former title challenger, was determined to prove he still had what it takes to compete at the highest level.

          <br>

          <strong>Oezdemir</strong> came out aggressively from the start, immediately pressuring <strong>Menifield</strong> and landing powerful combinations. Despite eating a solid shot that momentarily stumbled him, <strong>Oezdemir</strong> continued to walk down his opponent, trapping him against the cage. A flush knee to the face followed by a barrage of punches ended <strong>Menifield's</strong> night early in the first round.

          <br>

          This impressive knockout victory allows <strong>Oezdemir</strong> to defend his top-10 ranking and demonstrates that he remains a dangerous force in the light heavyweight division. While he expressed interest in another title shot, he'll likely need a few more wins against top competition to re-enter that conversation. For <strong>Menifield</strong>, this setback halts the momentum he had built with two wins earlier in 2025.

          <br>

      <div class="fight" id="myktybek-orolbai-vs-jack-hermansson">
        <h3>Myktybek Orolbai vs. Jack Hermansson</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Overhand Right at 2:46 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>
          This welterweight contest featured a concerning scenario as <strong>Jack Hermansson</strong> moved down from middleweight just months after suffering a devastating knockout. He faced <strong>Myktybek Orolbai</strong>, who was moving up from lightweight after previously missing weight.

          <br>
          <br>

          The fighters started cautiously, feeling each other out with jabs and low kicks. <strong>Orolbai</strong> seemed more intent on landing power shots, possibly aware of <strong>Hermansson's</strong> recent knockout loss. Midway through the round, <strong>Orolbai</strong> landed a massive right hand that sent <strong>Hermansson</strong> crashing to the canvas, following up with unnecessary shots after the fight was clearly over.

          <br>
          <br>

          This second brutal knockout in a short period raises serious concerns about <strong>Hermansson's</strong> future in the sport. At minimum, he'll need to take significant time off to recover, and his championship aspirations appear to be over. For <strong>Orolbai</strong>, this impressive victory should earn him a ranked opponent as he looks to establish himself in the welterweight division.

          <br>

      <div class="fight" id="waldo-cortes-acosta-vs-shamil-gaziev">
        <h3>Waldo Cortes-Acosta vs. Shamil Gaziev</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Right Hook at 1:22 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>
          This heavyweight clash came together on just two days' notice after Sergei Spivac pulled out, with <strong>Waldo Cortes-Acosta</strong> literally flying from Costa Rica to Qatar to make weight and take the fight. He faced <strong>Shamil Gaziev</strong>, a top prospect known for his finishing ability.

          <br>
          <br>

          <strong>Gaziev</strong> started aggressively, walking forward with bad intentions, but walked directly into a huge shot from <strong>Cortes-Acosta</strong> that stumbled him. Sensing the finish, <strong>Cortes-Acosta</strong> pounced with another clean right hand that put <strong>Gaziev</strong> on the canvas, following up with ground and pound to secure the victory.

          <br>
          <br>

          This marks <strong>Cortes-Acosta's</strong> fifth fight in 2025, improving his record to 4-1 on the year. With back-to-back spectacular finishes against surging contenders, he has positioned himself for a potential number one contender bout, possibly against Alexander Volkov. For <strong>Gaziev</strong>, this setback is significant, and the damage sustained raises questions about how it might affect him moving forward.

      <div class="fight" id="kyoji-horiguchi-vs-tagir-ulanbekov">
        <h3>Kyoji Horiguchi vs. Tagir Ulanbekov</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Rear Naked Choke at 2:18 Round 3 of 3, 12:18 Total</p>
        <p>
          This flyweight matchup featured the highly anticipated UFC return of legendary fighter <strong>Kyoji Horiguchi</strong> against <strong>Tagir Ulanbekov</strong>, a member of Team Khabib riding a four-fight win streak. This was a pivotal fight for both men's championship aspirations.

          <br>
          <br>

          The first round was competitive, with <strong>Ulanbekov</strong> securing takedowns and controlling <strong>Horiguchi</strong> against the fence. However, the momentum shifted dramatically in the second round when <strong>Horiguchi</strong> came out with renewed aggression, landing vicious leg kicks that compromised <strong>Ulanbekov's</strong> movement and following up with powerful strikes. By the third round, <strong>Horiguchi</strong> was in complete control, eventually landing a flush head kick that sent <strong>Ulanbekov</strong> to the canvas before securing a fight-ending rear naked choke.

          <br>
          <br>

          This spectacular return to the UFC establishes <strong>Horiguchi</strong> as a legitimate contender in the flyweight division, with a top-10 matchup likely next. While he called for a title shot, he may need one more win to secure it. For <strong>Ulanbekov</strong>, this loss is a significant setback after building a four-fight win streak, demonstrating the harsh reality of competition at the highest level.

        <h3>Luke Riley vs. Bogdan Grad</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Left Hook and Ground Punches at 0:30 Round 2 of 3, 5:30 Total</p>
        <p>
          This preliminary bout featured UFC debutant <strong>Luke Riley</strong>, who was originally supposed to fight on the Contender Series but was prevented by visa issues, against <strong>Bogdan Grad</strong>, who was looking to rebound from a previous loss.

          <br>
          <br>

          The first round was dominated by <strong>Grad</strong>, who secured multiple takedowns and controlled <strong>Riley</strong> on the ground, landing shots from top position. However, <strong>Riley</strong> showed composure in surviving the grappling onslaught. In the second round, <strong>Riley</strong> came out with purpose and landed a nasty left hook that sent <strong>Grad</strong> to the canvas, following up with ground and pound to secure the knockout victory.

          <br>
          <br>

          This impressive comeback victory keeps <strong>Riley</strong> undefeated and demonstrates his punching power, though it also revealed significant vulnerabilities in his grappling that more experienced opponents will likely exploit. For <strong>Grad</strong>, this second consecutive loss puts his UFC roster spot in serious jeopardy heading into his next bout.

      <div class="fight" id="nicolas-dalby-vs-saygid-izagakhmaev">
        <h3>Nicolas Dalby vs. Saygid Izagakhmaev</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Split at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          This matchup pitted veteran <strong>Nicolas Dalby</strong> against highly-touted prospect <strong>Saygid Izagakhmaev</strong>, who came from Team Khabib with significant expectations. The UFC clearly intended to build <strong>Izagakhmaev</strong> using <strong>Dalby's</strong> name value.

          <br>
          <br>

          Unfortunately, this fight failed to deliver excitement, devolving into extended periods of stalling against the cage with neither fighter able to establish dominance or create meaningful offense. <strong>Izagakhmaev</strong> secured several takedowns but couldn't maintain control, while <strong>Dalby</strong> implemented a conservative gameplan focused on neutralizing his opponent's attacks. In the end, the judges awarded <strong>Dalby</strong> a split decision victory.

          <br>
          <br>

          This performance raises serious questions about <strong>Izagakhmaev's</strong> potential, as he failed to demonstrate the dominant grappling expected from a fighter with his pedigree. He'll likely get one more chance against lower-level competition to prove he belongs in the UFC. For <strong>Dalby</strong>, this victory extends his career but does little to generate excitement for his future matchups.

        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Guillotine Choke at 0:22 Round 3 of 3, 10:22 Total</p>
        <p>
          This flyweight contest featured pivotal implications for the division, with veteran <strong>Alex Perez</strong> looking to make one last run at title contention against <strong>Asu Almabayev</strong>, a training partner of Shavkat Rakhmonov who had found success in the UFC.

          <br>
          <br>

          Through the first two rounds, <strong>Perez</strong> controlled the action, coming forward aggressively and landing combinations while effectively defending <strong>Almabayev's</strong> takedown attempts. <strong>Perez</strong> appeared to be on his way to a decision victory heading into the third round. However, just 22 seconds into the final frame, <strong>Almabayev</strong> caught <strong>Perez</strong> in a tight standing guillotine choke that forced the tap.

          <br>
          <br>

          This spectacular comeback victory keeps <strong>Almabayev</strong> in the title conversation at flyweight, likely earning him a top-5 opponent in his next outing. For <strong>Perez</strong>, this second consecutive loss effectively ends his championship aspirations, though he remains a dangerous test for contenders in the division.

        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Rear Naked Choke at 0:33 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>
          This light heavyweight bout featured UFC debutant <strong>AbdulRakhman Yakhyaev</strong>, who earned his contract with a first-round TKO on the Contender Series, against <strong>Raffael Cerqueira</strong>, who was fighting to keep his UFC career alive on a three-fight losing streak.

          <br>
          <br>

          <strong>Yakhyaev</strong> wasted no time, immediately coming out with spinning back kicks that put <strong>Cerqueira</strong> on the defensive. A head kick sent <strong>Cerqueira</strong> to the canvas, and <strong>Yakhyaev</strong> quickly followed him to the ground, secured a body triangle, and locked in a rear naked choke that forced the tap just 33 seconds into the fight.

          <br>
          <br>

          This spectacular debut establishes <strong>Yakhyaev</strong> as an exciting prospect in the light heavyweight division, though it's difficult to gauge his true potential given the limited opposition and quick finish. At just 24 years old, the UFC can take their time developing him against progressively tougher competition. For <strong>Cerqueira</strong>, this fourth consecutive loss likely marks the end of his UFC tenure.

        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          This bantamweight contest carried significant interest as <strong>Aleksandre Topuria</strong>, older brother and coach of champion Ilia Topuria, looked to prove he belonged in the UFC in his own right. He faced <strong>Bekzat Almakhan</strong>, who had significantly more high-level experience, including a decision loss to top contender Umar Nurmagomedov.

          <br>
          <br>

          The fight started competitively, with <strong>Almakhan</strong> finding success with low kicks that repeatedly put <strong>Topuria</strong> on the canvas. However, as the fight progressed, <strong>Topuria</strong> began to find his rhythm, landing powerful right hands that busted up <strong>Almakhan's</strong> face. While <strong>Topuria</strong> secured several takedowns, he struggled to control <strong>Almakhan</strong> on the ground or advance his position effectively.

          <br>
          <br>

          This victory establishes <strong>Topuria</strong> as a legitimate UFC fighter, though he demonstrated clear vulnerabilities, particularly to low kicks and in his grappling effectiveness. He'll need more experience before facing ranked competition. For <strong>Almakhan</strong>, this loss suggests he may need to take a step back in competition to rebuild momentum.

        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Overhand Right at 1:26 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>
          This middleweight bout featured two fighters looking to rebound from losses and avoid falling into the dangerous territory of back-to-back defeats in the promotion. <strong>Ismail Naurdiev</strong> was coming off a controversial loss to Jun Yong Park, while <strong>Ryan Loder</strong> was looking to bounce back from a TKO defeat.

          <br>
          <br>

          <strong>Naurdiev</strong> needed just over a minute to end the fight, landing a devastating left hand directly on <strong>Loder's</strong> chin that immediately shut off his lights. The knockout was so decisive that no follow-up shots were necessary, with <strong>Loder</strong> out cold before he hit the canvas.

          <br>
          <br>

          This spectacular knockout victory reestablishes <strong>Naurdiev</strong> as a legitimate force in the middleweight division, demonstrating that he's better than his record suggests. He deserves a step up in competition against more experienced opponents. For <strong>Loder</strong>, this second consecutive knockout loss likely puts him on the chopping block, continuing the trend of TUF alumni struggling to find success in the modern UFC.

        <h3>Nurullo Aliev vs. Shaqueme Rock</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          This matchup featured undefeated prospect <strong>Nurullo Aliev</strong> in his third UFC appearance against debutant <strong>Shaqueme Rock</strong>, who had an interesting backstory after finding MMA while on the run for a crime he didn't commit.

          <br>
          <br>

          From the opening bell, <strong>Aliev</strong> established dominance, clipping <strong>Rock</strong> with a nasty left hook early in the first round and controlling the action throughout the fight. <strong>Aliev</strong> systematically broke down <strong>Rock</strong> with powerful left hands, mixing in grappling against the fence to further dominate the action. While <strong>Rock</strong> showed heart in surviving, he never established a clear path to victory.

          <br>

          This dominant performance improves <strong>Aliev's</strong> UFC record to 3-0 and establishes him as a legitimate prospect who deserves a step up in competition against fighters just outside the rankings. For <strong>Rock</strong>, this matchup may have been too much too soon, as he was given an undefeated prospect with UFC experience without having fought on the Contender Series first. He should receive a more appropriate matchup next to properly gauge his potential.

        <h3>Denzel Freeman vs. Marek Bujło</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          The opening bout of the evening featured two heavyweights making their UFC debuts, with <strong>Denzel Freeman</strong> taking the fight on short notice after the original opponent pulled out, facing undefeated <strong>Marek Bujło</strong>.

          Unfortunately, this fight failed to deliver the explosive action typically expected from heavyweight matchups, with both fighters showing clear signs of UFC debut jitters. The bout was characterized by hesitation and unwillingness to engage, with low output throughout all three rounds. <strong>Freeman</strong> found some success with outside low kicks, while <strong>Bujło</strong> occasionally landed teep kicks up the middle, but neither fighter committed to significant offense.

          In the end, <strong>Freeman</strong> secured the unanimous decision victory in what was overall a dull fight. While he has a strong grappling pedigree, he failed to utilize it in this bout. Both fighters will need to show more aggression and willingness to engage in their next UFC appearances to secure their spots on the roster.
