          Hi, my name is Pat Stefanou. I am originally from Greenwich, Connecticut but moved away to Boston to study and play water polo at the Massachusetts
          Institute of Technology. After graduating with both a BS in Computer Science and an MEng in Machine Learning,
          I moved to Seattle, Washington to work as a Software Engineer for Stripe. I have a passion for innovation and technology, and my main interests
          are full-stack web development, cloud infrastructure, and machine learning. Outside of technology, I love training for both marathons and triathlons, watching UFC, and hanging out with 
          friends and family. I hope you enjoy my website!

                <li>Main focus of contributions when at Stripe. Distributed system written using Temporal in Scala. The Kafka Control Plane is the service that we use to automate maintenance operations for our kafka clusters. For example, operations such as cluster rebalancing, broker replacements, and cluster rolling restarts.</li>
                <li>Contributed topic configuration management workflow to Kafka Control Plane that manages all topic configurations for all users, across all Kafka clusters at Stripe</li>
                <li>workflow coordination mechanism that prevents multiple cluster operations from being applied to a Kafka cluster at the same time. I did this by writing a locking mechanism that leverages Temporal’s mutual exclusion Workflow Id principals. Whenever an operation is to be run on a Kafka cluster, a LockWorkflow is spawned that has the name of the kafka cluster it is operating on. So for example, if you have a kafka cluster name kafka-00 and you want to replace a broker on said cluster, a LockWorkflow must be spawned with the cluster name. If there is a lock that is already acquired on the cluster, then the operation trying to acquire the lock will spin until it can acquire the lock, and proceed as normal. Ultimately, this doesn’t help with providing ordering and priority to specific operations, but it prevents multiple operations being applied to a cluster at once that could result in dire states, such as under the minimum number of in-sync replicas.</li>

              <ul class="description">
                <li>Selected to NeurIPs 2021</li>
                <li>we provide the first computationally and statistically efficient estimators for truncated linear regression when the noise variance is unknown, estimating both the linear model and the variance of the noise. Our estimator is based on an efficient implementation of Projected Stochastic Gradient Descent on the negative log-likelihood of the truncated sample. Importantly, we show that the error of our estimates is asymptotically normal, and we use this to provide explicit confidence regions for our estimates</li>
                <li>Conducted experiments no both synthetic and semi-synthetic data to show the algorithm's performance in practice; <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pstefanou12/Truncated-Regression-With-Unknown-Noise-Variance-NeurIPS-2021">see github</a></li>

              <li>Developed a package to remove bias from statistical models that are impacted by truncation</li>
              <li>I wrote the package in Python using PyTorch’s built in autograd framework. Although it may have made sense to use a framework like NumPy instead for the package, I chose PyTorch because we were trying to remove bias from DNNs. delphi.ai has a trainer module that allows you to pass in different statistical models and gradients and perform gradient descent on them. Because of this design goal, PyTorch seemed like the sensible choice for this.</li>

              I gave a similar talk on the Kafka Control Plane at Temporal Replay 2023 in Bellevue, Washington. This was my first conference talk. Although it wasn’t the best presentation, I am glad that I stepped out of my comfort zone and gave a presentation in front of an audience of developers. I’d like to continue to give talks and contribute more to the open source community.

A Kafka Control Plane that performs maintenance operations on Kafka clusters. A Kafka Archiver that writes data from Kafka Clusters to S3. 
                Over the course of my time at Stripe, I have had the opportunity to take a handful of responsibilities. I held the pager and responded to incidents during on-call, spun up new team members, designed and implemented components of a distributed system, and learned about Kafka internals. 
                The majority of the code was done in Java and Scala, but I received exposure to working with other programming languages such as Go, Ruby, and Python.

                  <div>Python</div>
                  <div>Great, easy-to-use language that provides functionality for nearly everything. Can be used for backend web development, infrastructure, data science, you name it. I find it very easy to write Python code and get something working with its scripting style.</div>

              <div class="programming-language two-column-item" id="java">
                  <div>Java</div>
                  <div>Extremely verbose. Almost too verbose. I think that writing Java is a pain, given all of the boiler plate code that goes into writing a Java Application. Typing is a nice feature, and code compilation is nice because it helps with debugging before running either test cases or deploying a service within QA. I think that Java’s verbosity and abstraction is a double edged sword. Abstracting functionality away through helper functions, can provide high-level functions that are easy to follow, but debugging or investigating a Java Application can be difficult when digging through layers of abstraction on abstraction. I personally find it hard to follow Java codebases that abstract complexity away too aggressively.</div>

              <div class="programming-language two-column-item" id="scala">
                  <div>Scala</div>
                  <div>Scala is a language that provides a lot of flexibility in how you write it. It has OOP and functional programming capabilities. Because of this, coders have a lot of power over how to write their programs which is ultimately a disaster. Using callbacks and chaining multiple operations looks pretty in code, but it typically isn’t taught in schools and has a steep learning curve when starting out. Not many developers are learning about Monads and SemiGroups when studying in college - cats. Given Scala’s flexibility, it is very hard to have multiple developers contribute to a Scala project. I think that the only time to use Scala is for personal projects or if there is a strict style guide and review process required before making contributions. In my opinion, using Scala within a large company is a poor design choice.</div>

              <div class="programming-language two-column-item" id="go">
                  <div>Go</div>
                  <div>I am not an expert in Go, but I have some experience. Go is a low-level language that allows you to deal with things such as pointers, but does not require you to manage memory by yourself. It is the right mix of low and high level programming. Setting up concurrent operations is very straightforward with go routines and channels. Go also provides great out of the box observability into your program’s concurrency with Go dumps. It also is a very simple language with less flexibility like Scala, that makes it easier to understand when spinning up onto a new project.</div>

              <div class="programming-language two-column-item" id="ruby">
                  <div>Ruby</div>
                  <div>I worked with Ruby a bit at Stripe. I don’t know why you would use Ruby at this point over other backend languages. Static type checkers like Sorbet make it easier to use and may be a reason to use it over Python, but I personally would not use it when starting a new project.</div>
