      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        On Saturday, October 18, 2025, the UFC returned to Vancouver with a middleweight showdown between Brendan Allen and Reinier de Ridder in the main event. What was originally supposed to be a title eliminator between de Ridder and Anthony Hernandez turned into something completely different when Allen stepped in on short notice, and the result was a statement-making performance that shook up the middleweight division.<br><br>

        In the main event, Brendan Allen proved why he's been one of the most underrated fighters in the middleweight division. Taking the fight on just 3.5 weeks' notice against a surging de Ridder, Allen dominated with devastating ground and pound that ultimately forced de Ridder's corner to retire him after the fourth round. With the win, Allen positioned himself for a potential fight against the top contenders in the division.<br><br>

        The co-main event saw Mike "Proper" Malott extend his win streak to three with a unanimous decision win over Kevin Holland, though the fight was marred by controversy due to multiple groin shots that clearly affected Holland's ability to compete. Meanwhile, Canadian favorite Aiemann Zahabi extended his win streak to seven with a split decision victory over Marlon Vera in front of a raucous home crowd.<br><br>

        Other notable performances included Manon Fiorot's first-round destruction of Jasmine Jasudavicius, announcing her return to title contention after losing to Valentina Shevchenko earlier in the year. Charles Jourdain looked sharp at bantamweight, submitting Davey Grant with a guillotine choke in the first round. The prelims featured some controversy as well, with Dan Miragliotta making questionable decisions in the Nelson vs. Frevola fight.<br><br>

        Overall, the card delivered solid action from top to bottom, earning its 7.1/10 rating. I was debating on whether to give it a 6.9 or 7.1, but went ahead and gave it a 7.1. While it didn't have the star power of a pay-per-view, and the co-main and main events didn't fully deliver as far as entertainment goes, the rest of the fights were competitive, the finishes were entertaining, and the main event provided real implications for the middleweight division. The Canadian crowd brought incredible energy, especially for Zahabi's victory, making this a memorable Fight Night event.

        <h3>Brendan Allen vs. Reinier de Ridder</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Retirement at 5:00 Round 4 of 5, 20:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          Reinier de Ridder entered the UFC in November 2024 at UFC Fight Night: Magny vs. Prates and immediately went on a tear, entering his fifth fight in a 12-month period at UFC Vancouver. All four previous fights resulted in wins, with his biggest victory coming against Robert Whittaker at UFC Abu Dhabi in July. Brendan Allen came into this fight on short notice to replace Anthony "Fluffy" Hernandez, who had pulled out. Allen had mixed success lately but was coming off a dominant unanimous decision win over Marvin Vettori at UFC 319 in July.<br><br>

          <img src="../../img/RDR_gassed.jpg", alt="RDR Gassed" style="float: right; width: 325px; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;"">

          Originally, the fight between Hernandez and de Ridder was set to be a title contender fight, with the two racing against the winner of Imavov vs. Borralho at UFC Paris in September. The winner with the better performance was going to get the next shot against Chimaev. Even with Hernandez pulling out, de Ridder showed how game he was by shifting focus to take a much riskier fight against Brendan Allen, with questionable title fight implications.<br><br>

          The fight started with de Ridder using a judo throw to get Allen to the ground early in the first. He threatened an arm triangle to no avail. After taking the back, Allen just went for wrist control to prevent de Ridder from securing a choke. Allen spent the rest of the first round playing defense, praying that de Ridder did not score a TKO win or submission.<br><br>

          Allen bounced back well in Round 2 with devastating ground and pound from the mount position, delivering brutal elbows to de Ridder's face. In the third, de Ridder went back to his bread and butter, getting an immediate body lock that led to a takedown and back take. Allen then reversed the position and brought the fight back to his world, returning to the devastating ground and pound. Allen spent the next three minutes delivering punishment to de Ridder. de Ridder attempted a reverse triangle in the last 20 seconds that didn't succeed. Allen took the third to go up 2-1, and de Ridder wobbled back to the stool completely gassed.<br><br>

          Allen landed an statement making body slam to start the fourth! He continued to smother de Ridder with ground and pound from mount and took the fourth. Going into the last round, de Ridder needed a finish to keep his title fight aspirations alive, but he was spent. Referee Jason Herzon went to check in with de Ridder and his corner in between the fourth and fifth rounds, and de Ridder's corner threw in the towel, declaring a TKO win for Brendan Allen. Unreal. All title fight aspirations gone.<br><br>

          There are multiple takeaways from this fight. Most importantly, Nassourdine Imavov is undeniable for the next title shot. The UFC Vancouver main event was not exciting enough to overshadow Imavov's five fight win streak over top middleweight competition. Overall, the de Ridder vs Allen fight had interesting scrambles, but was rather lackluster, with no "holy shit" moments. Another question is whether the top contenders within the middleweight division are overrated? You have a contingent of fighters—Strickland, DDP, Adesanya, Whittaker, Costa—who just fight amongst themselves without giving many opportunities to up-and-comers like Allen, Hernandez, Imavov, and Borralho. With fights not being made, it's unclear whether current rankings check out.<br><br>

          For de Ridder, it's time to take some time off. Four months minimum. Time to go back home, rest, recover, and spend some time with his family. I think that if the schedules line up, the UFC should run the Hernandez fight back. In the post-fight interview, Brendan Allen called out Chimaev, DDP, and Strickland. I think that the DDP fight is the most likely and most intriguing fight for Allen next. There's bad blood, and it will take him a step closer to the title. This is without doubt the biggest win of Brendan Allen's career. To all the UFC fighters out there, stay in shape, risk is rewarding! But you can only take risk if you are always ready to 'rock and roll'.

        <h3>Mike Malott vs. Kevin Holland</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          The journeyman Kevin "Big Mouth" Holland continues to be a "fan favorite" as he looked to get his third win of the year. I am starting to get fed up with Kevin Holland because I don't understand what either he or the UFC is trying to do. He isn't particularly good, and isn't particularly funny. His fights are somewhat entertaining, but his card placement does not make sense for what he brings to the table. On the other hand, after suffering a setback losing to Neil Magny at UFC 297, Mike Malott looked to build a three-fight win streak and start getting higher-ranked opponents.<br><br>

          A controversial groin shot from Malott led to a five-minute stoppage in the first round but resulted in no point deduction. Even after five minutes of dead time, Kevin Holland was still hurting and holding his balls for the last minute of the first. It is important to note that this was the second groin shot to Kevin Holland in about 90 seconds in the first round. Optically, it looked terrible, but you never know with a guy like Kevin Holland. The dude is there to get a paycheck, and doesn't seem to care about the results. If he could get a DQ for Malott, that's a win in his eyes. Still, Holland should not have kept fighting, because no one wants to watch a grown man run around the octagon holding his sack for 12 minutes. Also, Kevin Holland spent the time between rounds just complaining about his groin. After the five minute break, I was ready to move on from this.<br><br>

          They brought a doctor in to "evaluate" Kevin Holland after the first round, but not during the official timeout. Weird. What is a doctor going to do without a full inspection by taking his pants off? All the doctor did was ask Holland, "Can you continue?" To which Holland responded by pacing around neither confirming nor denying whether he could continue. It felt like Holland didn't want to keep fighting, but didn't want to say he "wanted out." I'll tell it how I see it. Kevin Holland is a jerk off. He's always trying to control the narrative, so that he can still be placed highly on cards, and receive unwarranted payment. If he's opaque about whether he can continue, if the doctor calls off the fight, he can say, "Ah man! I am good to fight! What are you doing?" I hope Kevin Holland retires soon or the UFC cuts him. At this point, he is a "fan favorite" that the UFC can throw on cards, and claim that it is stacked without having to do some actual match-making. Also, Kevin Holland fights so much, he can't train enough to improve his weaknesses, and he doesn't fight to win. So, when you watch him fight, you need to ask yourself, "If he doesn't even care about the fight. Why should I?"<br><br>
          
          The rest of the fight was weird. In the second, Malott was clearly timid because he didn't want to either get another groin shot or had some respect for Holland. Holland just moon-walked around the Octagon with his hand in his pants.<br><br>

          In the third, Holland came back with some big shots, and Malott's nose got slightly busted. It was a fairly close round, until Malott employed some slick grappling in the last 90 seconds of the fight. At the end, Malott took the unanimous decision, winning the last two rounds.<br><br> 
          
          As a result, Malott is now on a three-fight win streak, while Kevin Holland loses his last two. It is unfortunate because the groin shots definitely had a large impact on the overall result of the fight.<br><br>

          Malott will now enter the rankings. Welterweight is pretty stacked at the moment, and I don't see Malott going very far against the top of division, but I'd  like to see him fight someone like Geoff Neal. If he can get past him, then we can start talking about some serious matchups.

      <div class="fight" id="aiemann-zahabi-vs-marlon-vera">
        <h3>Aiemann Zahabi vs. Marlon Vera</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Split at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          After getting schooled by O'Malley in the most promotion's most undeserved title shot ever at UFC 299, and losing to Deiveson Figueiredo at UFC Fight Night: Sandhagen vs. Nurmagomedov, Vera looked to get back on track after over a year out of the cage. Zahabi, riding a six-fight win streak and coming off a big win over Jose Aldo at UFC 315, looked to get his seventh consecutive win and become a legitimate title contender at bantamweight.<br><br>

          Overall, Zahabi moved much better than Chito—circling and feinting much more. Chito used his typical tactics, just moving forward and backward, hoping that his chin holds up. The first round was even, with Zahabi being the much more active fighter. Whereas Chito inflicted more damage, giving Zahabi a bloody nose.<br><br>

          Vera got a big knockdown in the second with his jab, but Zahabi recovered—arguably grabbing the fence to stay in the fight. Vera continued to follow up with big combinations, including a memorable body shot. Zahabi finished the round pouring pressure onto Vera to gain some respect, but not enough to win back the round.<br><br>

          The boys were scrapping in the third. Zahabi hit Vera with a big left that caused a serious reaction from Vera. Then with a minute left in the fight, Zahabi blitzed and showed incredible heart in front of the Canadian home crowd. The end of third round was an absolute "barn burner," with the lads throwing everything and the kitchen sink in the last 10 seconds.<br><br>

          The fight resulted in a split decision win for Aiemann Zahabi. Zahabi now increases his win streak to seven, and Vera drops to 0-3 in his last three. I personally think that Vera won the fight, taking the first two rounds. I lean towards Vera in the first because he broke Zahabi's nose. Unfortunately, I think that Vera wins that fight anywhere besides Canada. I don't think that the judges are implicitly biased, but if when you are in a crowded arena that cheers vigorously for one particular fighter, and attack will seem much more impactful/significant for the fan favorite.<br><br>

          Chito will have to see what his future is within the promotion. Regardless, if he stays with the UFC, he will need to fight far down the rankings. Zahabi called out 'Suga' Sean O'Malley, but I don't think that will happen because rumors are that O'Malley has his sights on a Song Yadong matchup. Regardless, I think Zahabi gets sparked by O'Malley. I think a fight with Deiveson Figueiredo would have been a better callout. Realistically, I think the UFC will give Zahabi Cory Sandhagen, because there are currently no fresh matchups for Sandhagen in the top 15. Once the Sandhagen fight happens, the Zahabi hype train should finally come to a stop.

      <div class="fight" id="manon-fiorot-vs-jasmine-jasudavicius">
        <h3>Manon Fiorot vs. Jasmine Jasudavicius</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Punches and Knees at 1:14 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>
          Coming into UFC Vancouver, Fiorot was fresh off a title fight unanimous decision loss to Valentina Shevchenko at UFC 315 and was looking to get back on track. After losing to Tracy Cortez at UFC Fight Night: Grasso vs. Shevchenko 2 by unanimous decision, Jasudavicius was on a five-fight win streak, on the brink of a title shot.  Jasudavicius's notable wins included Jéssica Andrade at UFC 315—a former champion—and Mayra Bueno Silva at UFC Fight Night: Adesanya vs. Imavov, a former title challenger.<br><br>

          Boos echoed throughout the stadium with Dan Miragliotta re-entered the cage to ref after the Nelson vs. Frevola blunder earlier in the card. It was a quick night at the office for Manon, as Fiorot clipped Jasudavicius in the first and then destroyed her with ground and pound for the TKO win! With the win, Fiorot solidifies herself as a contender in the flyweight division.<br><br>

          With Fiorot winning last night, I think that Natalia Silva solidifies herself as the next flyweight title contender after the title fight at MSG next month. If Shevchenko gets it done next week, Fiorot definitely needs one more win before getting back to the title. She should wait to see who fights for the title next and how the fight between Erin Blanchfield vs. Tracy Cortez plays out at UFC 323.<br><br>

          I think that Jasudavicius can come back soon if she wants to, but she'll probably need to take a step back and fight back in the rankings. A Miranda Maverick fight makes sense next in my opinion.

          </div>
          Leading into this fight, Davey Grant moved from England to Abu Dhabi, and then ultimately landed in Vegas, settling in at Syndicate MMA to work with John Wood. After moving both his family and weight class in the UFC, Grant looked to make a statement win, and that he's here for long run in the UFC bantamweight division. Unfortunately, he did not live up to these expectations.<br><br>

          The fight started with a nasty flying knee from Jourdain, right into some nasty ground and pound. Grant somehow managed to not get knocked out, but that's about all he could do. Immediately after Grant recovered, Jourdain snuck in a tight guillotine and got the tap. An absolutley electrifying performance from Jourdain!<br><br>

          Jourdain is looking good at bantamweight, going 2-0 in his first two bouts. Marcus McGhee is a good callout by him, but it would be a big jump up the rankings. If he doesn't get McGhee, I think that Bryce Mitchell would be a good matchup for him before challenging the top 15.

      <div class="fight" id="kyle-nelson-vs-matt-frevola">
        <h3>Kyle Nelson vs. Matt Frevola</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          Before UFC Vancouver, Frevola was on a two-fight losing streak, getting gnarly KOs from both BSD and Fares Ziam. He took a year off after each of the losses. Coming into this fight, he looked to bounce back and get his second wind in his UFC career.<br><br>
          
          The fight was pretty even on the feet in the first, with Frevola able to get a takedown. Towards the end of the first, Nelson knocked Frevola down with a clean right. Nelson pounced on his prey and finished Frevola with ground and pound with three seconds left in the first round.<br><br>

          After the TKO, Dan Miragliotta said that the fight wasn't over and that he merely stopped the fight to indicate the end of the round. This is one the most heinous refereeing decisions that I have ever seen in the sport. It is entirely possible that Miragliotta legitimately thought that the round was over, but he stopped the fight with time left on the clock! Not only that, but Frevola was out of it. Nelson was raining down punishment, and Frevola had no response. Unacceptable. It is ironic that this happened on the card, because there was a similar controversy at UFC Perth in September with the Neil Magny vs Jake Matthews bout. Fortunately, tonight, Nelson was luckier than Jake Matthews as he proceeded to win the fight.<br><br>
          
          Coming out of the first round, Frevola was seriously gassed, and Nelson was able to capitalize. Nelson ended up pulling out the unanimous decision in front of his home crowd, while Frevola now falls to 0-3 in his last three outings.<br><br>
          
          I don't know what lies ahead for Frevola in the UFC. Nelson made his lightweight debut and looked alright. I think that Chase Hooper could be a good next fight for Nelson.

        <h3>Drew Dober vs. Kyle Prepolec</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Punches, Knees, and Elbows at 1:16 Round 3 of 3, 11:16 Total</p>
        <p>
          Before coming into this one, Drew Dober was on a three-fight losing streak with his spot in the UFC on the line. Besides being good looking, I don't know what Dober is good at. At the beginning, Dober was able to 'fight his fight', leading the dance and putting the pressure on Prepolec.<br><br>

          Dober split his left shin after throwing tons of low calf kicks to Prepolec's shin. Dober was getting beat up, but it seemed like Dober was hitting Prepolec with a lot more volume. Prepolec started having success, really laying into Dober in the second, forcing Dober to attempt to grapple.<br><br>

          Going into the third, it was anyone's fight with each fighter taking one of the first two rounds. Mid-way through the third, Dober delivered a nasty low blow to Prepolec, causing the Canadian to fall in excruciating pain. The commission urged the referee, John Cooper, to take a point from Dober, but Cooper was hesitant. Cooper ultimately took a point in a very peculiar way, because it seemed like he only took the point when Prepolec was taking a long time to recover. As a ref, you either take a point or you don't. You can't sit on the decision, get swayed by the comission and decide what to do minutes after the foul is committed.<br><br>
           
          After receiving his punishment, the pressure was on for Dober. It was knock out or lose. Fortunately, Dober got a second wind, let the bezerker go, and successfully finished the fight to save his career.<br><br>

          Unfortunately for Prepolec, if Dober doesn't give a low blow, I think that Dober loses the fight most times out of ten.

        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Straight Right to Hammerfists at 0:21 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>
          The commentary previewing this fight was extremely biased towards Gibson. DC and Magan Olivi were complimenting Gibson, discussing how he came into this fight with a good camp, having dialed down his teaching. Not only that, he made a "Google Doc" to track heart rate, chest strap monitor, Ora ring...the works. But you know what they say, "heart rate don't matter if you don't make it out of the first round...let alone the first minute." Gibson went out there and got absolutely starched by Aoriqileng with a brutal right hand to the chin. The Mongolian followed up with some ground and pound, and Gibson was toast. There is clearly a lesson to be learned by Gibson here. If you walk into punches, who cares if you get out of zone 2?<br><br>

          At 38, Gibson should look to retire. The two-time UFC vet is 2-4 in his second stint with the promotion, and now he is looking to battle his way back into the rankings. If everything goes perfectly, he gets a title shot at 40, which seems unlikely. I think that Gibson needs to understand that his best days in the sport are behind, and look to tackle the next challenge/adventure in his life. With this nasty KO win, Aoriqileng gets back on track after suffering a setback loss to Raul Rosas Jr. at UFC 306, but I don't know what's next for the Mongolian.

        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Rear Naked Choke at 2:15 Round 3 of 3, 12:15 Total</p>
        <p>
          In the first round, Silva cut Park with a hammerfist elbow and broke Park's jaw with a clean right. Park struggled to get going in this fight, finding success neither on the feet or the ground.<br><br>

          Park came out swinging in the third, hitting Silva with brutal body shots to the liver. But it didn't take Silva long to turn the tides, and sink in a rear-naked choke. Silva proceeded to get a quick tap out of Park, defend his top 15 spot, and snap a two-fight loss streak.<br><br>

          Now on a two-fight losing streak, things are starting to look dicey for Park. If Kai Asakura doesn't go up to bantamweight, book it. Battle of the East Asians!

        <h3>Djorden Santos vs. Danny Barlow</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          Danny "Left Hand of God" Barlow and Djorden Santos squared off in a high-profile matchup on the prelims. Both having seen early success in the beginning of their UFC careers, both were looking to bounce back from their recent loses.<br><br>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">WANT A ROUND!?!?! Barlow piecing up Santos with the left and Santos is out on the feet.

          Early in the fight, the two fighters fought very cautiously. Both fought at range, and neither were willing to make any big advances.<br><br>

          In the second, Barlow started piecing up Santos with his signature left hand to the body and chin. Barlow was laying down heat and nearly got Santos out of there. Santos was then able to recover with a flurry of his own. Leading into the third round, it was all tied up at one a piece.<br><br>

          As the fight moved into the third, it was clear that Barlow was fatiguing. His hands were falling and he coudln't keep up the same volume we saw in the second. Barlow proceeded to make a terrible decision in pulling guard, and Santos capitalized, dishing some nice ground and pound.<br><br>

          Santos ultimately won the decision and gets back on track in the middlweight divison. On the other hand, it is very clear that Barlow is a one-dimensional fighter, with only his left hand at his disposal. He's a "one-trick pony," and is in dire need to augment his game. Not only that, Barlow lacks precision, constantly loading up and swinging with no game plan at all. Now on a two-fight losing streak, in a "must win" predicament, Barlow needs to get back in the gym and work on his both his kills and strategy.

          Unfortunately, I didn't pay much attention to this fight. Luciano dominated the fight and scored a rear-naked choke in the third round. Not much else to say.

        <h3>Yousri Belgaroui vs. Azamat Bekoev</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Punches at 0:55 Round 3 of 3, 10:55 Total</p>
        <p>
          Coming into UFC Vancouver, Bekoev had two nasty first-round KOs on his resume to start off his UFC career over Zach Reese and Ryan Loder. With a lot of hype, and the Russian fanbase on his side, Bekoev came in as a massive -295 betting favorite. Unfortunately, this hype was short-lived in the cage, as this fight turned into target practice for Belgaroui. Belgaroui fought like the taller fighter, keeping his range, throwing knees up the middle, and not letting Bekoev take the fight to his world on the ground.<br><br>

          Before his UFC debut tonight, Belgaroui struggled on the Contender Series in 2023, losing to Tulio by unanimous decision. After the setback, Belgaroui went on to rattle off two wins in Levels Fight League and returned to the Contender Series in 2024 with a vengeance, score a first-round KO over Taiga Iwasaki. Belgaroui is now on a four-fight win streak in MMA.<br><br>

          Belgaroui has fought both Adesanya and Pereira in kickboxing and has a win over Pereira. At 33 years old, it's time for him to make some moves in middleweight.

        <h3>Melissa Croden vs. Tainara Lisboa</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Punches From Top Position at 4:32 Round 3 of 3, 14:32 Total</p>
        <p>
          Croden was the bigger and longer figher. She won the exchanges on the feet with her stiff jab and big hooks. The second round was extremely dominant from Croden with intense ground and pound that Lisboa had no answer for. DC kept saying, "You gotta watch out for the armbar," whenever Croden was smothering Lisboa, and the only reason she was threatening it was because her legs were in the most insane position because she was getting dominated.<br><br>

          The third was much of the same, as Croden scored a nasty TKO win in her UFC debut.
