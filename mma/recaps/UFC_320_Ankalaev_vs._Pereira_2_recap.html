      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        The UFC returned to Las Vegas for the much anticipated rematch between Alex Pereira and Magomed Ankalaev. 
        Although their previous bout at UFC 313 wasn't a barn burner that captivated the world with what Dana calls 
        "Holy shit moments!", the pair did a good job selling the fight with hostile encounters at the UFC PI leading 
        up to the fight, and a general dislike for each other evident in all of their demeanors. To top this all off, 
        this headliner had a lot on the line, with an aging Pereira (38 years old) looking at one of his last opportunities 
        to reclaim UFC gold, and Ankalaev risking losing the title and having to climb his way back up the mountain to 
        title contention. Needless to say, there was a lot on the line. Ultimately, Pereira "righted" the wrong by knocking Ankalaev 
        out in spectacular fashion in the first 80 seconds to reclaim the light heavyweight title.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the co-main event, Merab Dvalishvili defeated Cory Sandhagen by unanimous decision, increasing his win 
        streak to 14 and his title defenses to 3. Sandhagen showed promise early in the first by keeping Dvalishvili at 
        range and taking the round. However, Dvalishvili's standup and relentless pressure proved to be too much to handle 
        yet again, and Merab effectively dominated for the rest of the fight.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the feature bout, Jiří Procházka squared off with Khalil Rountree in a high-profile match in the light 
        heavyweight division with title fight implications on the line. Khalil came out hot and put the pressure on Jiří, 
        and going into the third round, it was clear that Khalil was up 2-0 and Jiří needed a knockout. So, Jiří did what 
        Jiří does and threw caution to the wind and got the job done, knocking Khalil out at 3:04 in the third round. Cinema!
        <br>
        <br>
        Besides the fights at the top of the card, some other notable performances were Youssef Zalal's first-round submission 
        over featherweight firecracker Josh Emmett, Joe "Bodycam Off" Pyfer's second-round submission over Abus Magomedov, and 
        Ateba Gautier's absolute demolition of Tre'ston Vines in the first round.
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall, UFC 320 was a good event with a stellar main card—four out of five fights ended in a finish. Thus, the 
        overall card received a solid rating of 7.6/10. Leaving the event, there are a lot of open questions about 
        what is next. Will Pereira move up to heavyweight to fight Jon Jones or Tom Aspinall? Who will be the next LHW title fight contender? 
        Did Jiří do enough to take the shot away from Ulberg? Who is the next contender for Merab, who is currently on 
        this legendary run? Will Ateba Gautier finally get his first real test in the UFC? And what does the future hold for 
        Patchy Mix after going 0-2 in his first two UFC fights?      
        <br>
        <br>

      <div class="fight" id="alex-pereira-vs-magomed-ankalaev">
        <h3>Alex Pereira vs. Magomed Ankalaev</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Overhand Right to Grounded Elbows at 1:20 Round 1 of 5</p>
        <p>
          As discussed in the summary, there was a lot on the line for this title fight. Both were arguably fighting for their last chance at UFC gold, and to top it all off, they do not like each other. Leading into the fight, Pereira said, "I'm not going back to the tire shop," and he made sure of it on Saturday night.
          <br>
          <br>
          Immediately when the bell went off, Pereira sprinted across the Octagon, hitting "Big Ank" with a 1-2. Pereira kept the pressure on, not giving Ankalaev an inch, until he connected with a flush right hand that hurt Ankalaev badly. Ankalaev immediately dove for a takedown that put Pereira in a more favorable position. Pereira proceeded to rain down an onslaught of ground and pound to the head and the body until Herb Dean stepped in to stop the action.
          <br>
          <br>
          The UFC and UFC fans alike rejoice with the return of "Poatan" to the top of the UFC LHW division, with not just his stoic demeanor, but his exciting style and consistent activity. It is good to have King Pereira back where he belongs.
          <br>
          <br>
          Given his success, it is interesting to think about what is next to come for Pereira. In his post-fight speech, he gave a tribute to the late Arthur Jones, brother of UFC legend Jon Jones, who suddenly passed away on Friday, but didn't make a specific callout. People speculate that Pereira planned to call out Jon Jones for a heavyweight division superfight, but decided against doing it in his post-fight speech due to Friday's developments. Regardless, it looks like Pereira has his eyes set on heavyweight. Now that he has reclaimed the title, I don't see much reason for him to stay. I believe that there is a worthy contender in Carlos Ulberg waiting in the wings, but I can't imagine that scratches Pereira's itch at the moment, and I don't blame him. At 38 years old, Pereira is surely on the last leg of his career, and I think that with his dominance and willingness to constantly bail the UFC out when in a pinch, Poatan has earned the right to call his shot.
          <br>
          <br>
          Pereira may have his eyes set on the Jon Jones fight, but I would like him to wait and see how the Aspinall vs Gane fight plays out later this month at UFC 321. If Aspinall were to win, I think that an Aspinall vs Pereira matchup is the way to go. The allure of watching two knockout artists go at it is compelling, not to forget that Pereira would be vying for the unfathomable triple-belt champion status. If Aspinall is to win, I think that this matchup would be a no-brainer. Not to mention that the winner of the matchup would be setting up arguably the biggest fight in UFC history in Winner vs Jones.
          <br>
          <br>
          As for Ankalaev, the future doesn't look as bright. It is no secret that the UFC isn't the biggest fan of Ankalaev. I don't think that he is a particularly "boring" fighter (although his title win at UFC 313 was forgettable), but I don't think that he has the look to be a superstar. The language barrier doesn't help either. The UFC clearly tried their best to keep him away from UFC gold, making him go on a two-fight win streak over Walker and Rakic just to get back into title contention after a controversial draw decision against Jan Blachowicz at UFC 282. I think that Ankalaev should take some time, heal up his rib, and see who is at the top of the division after things play out. If Ulberg or Jiří don't get a title shot, that's a good matchup for him—still at the top of the division with title contention on the line. Moreover, it would be interesting to see a rematch vs Blachowicz, given how Jan's bout goes against Bogdan Guskov at UFC Fight Night 265.
          <br>
          <br>
          All in all, this was a memorable and "y'all must have forgot" performance from Alex Pereira. Pereira continues to show his dominance in combat sports and continues to push the needle on his star power. Pereira is "must-see TV," and I am looking forward to seeing what is in store for him next. 
        </p>

      <div class="fight" id="merab-dvalishvili-vs-cory-sandhagen">
        <h3>Merab Dvalishvili vs. Cory Sandhagen</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3</p>
        <p>
          Going into this fight, it didn't really feel like there was a true number one contender in the division. Given that Aljamain Sterling was a former champion and training partner of Merab Dvalishvili, Merab ran a lap around the rest of bantamweight and effectively killed off any possible contender. Thus, given his dominance, Sandhagen was the only fresh matchup and was granted a title shot.
          <br>
          <br>
          Although Cory was only on a one-fight win streak, he was able to hold his own against Merab. In the first round, Sandhagen kept the Dvalishvili onslaught at bay and kept his range. Sandhagen kept his composure and pieced the champ up on the outside and took the round. Alas, his success was short-lived, and in the second round, Merab showed his much-improved skill in the striking department and nearly knocked Sandhagen out on the feet. The fight could have arguably been stopped. Yet, leaving the second, it was clear that Merab had stolen not only the momentum of the fight but also the lead with a clear 10-8.
          <br>
          <br>
          The rest of the fight was a staple Merab victory, with continuous pressure and takedowns. Merab ended up surpassing the UFC takedown record with 117 career takedowns, with 20 of them coming within this fight alone. Cory wasn't completely embarrassed, but he couldn't hang with Merab's cardio.
          <br>
          <br>
          Nevertheless, I need to give some praise to Cory as he started to show the blueprint for beating Merab. He showed in the first that you can strike with Merab and win exchanges. Moreover, he showed how you can avoid being taken down by getting to the cage and controlling the wrists whenever Merab tries to take you down.
          <br>
          <br>
          Moving forward, I think that the only contender for Merab is Yan at the moment, who is on a three-fight streak. Still, given their first bout, I am not optimistic about Yan's chances in the rematch. I think that Sandhagen needs to put together a solid win streak to get back to title contention. Unfortunately, Sandhagen has faced the majority of the bantamweight division prior to this fight. I think that a fight with O'Malley would be interesting stylistically, but also a fresh matchup in the division.

      <div class="fight" id="jiří-procházka-vs-khalil-rountree-jr.">
        <h3>Jiří Procházka vs. Khalil Rountree Jr.</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Left Hook at 3:04 Round 3 of 3, 13:04 Total</p>
        <p>
          Cinema! Not much else to say. A classic Jiří performance where he went down early but came back with a big statement knockout against Khalil late in the third.
          <br>
          <br>
          Khalil came to fight and implemented a good game plan in the first and the second. He kept the pressure on and fought a very technical fight, throwing combinations at Jiří and capitalizing on Jiří's mistakes. Rountree was able to hold onto this in the first two rounds, until Jiří unleashed the tornado in the third, broke Khalil's will, and ended up knocking him out.
          <br>
          <br>
          The fight was extremely exciting and memorable, but I think that there is a lot to unpack besides the actual fight. Being on the same card as a light heavyweight title fight gave this matchup a lot of visibility for future title fights. Not only will a lot of fans see the matchup, but it tees up media and post-fight interviews for future title fight promos. I don't think Jiří explicitly called out Alex next, but he has alluded to the fact that he wants a title fight next.
          <br>
          <br>
          Although Khalil got knocked out in the third, I still think that the biggest loser of the fight was Carlos Ulberg. Currently on a nine-fight win streak in the UFC with wins over former champion Jan Blachowicz, former title contender Volkan Oezdemir, and a statement first-round knockout over Dominik Reyes a week prior, I believe that Ulberg should be the front-runner for a title shot. Unfortunately, having been on a lackluster UFC Perth card the weekend prior with not much buzz around it, most fans don't even know who Ulberg is. We need to see what Pereira decides to do next before saying who fights for the title, but I don't care to see Pereira vs Procházka 3. The first two fights were not particularly competitive (both resulting in Pereira knockouts), and it doesn't seem that Jiří has made the adjustments required to beat Pereira. Jiří still gets hit a lot, and the main difference between Khalil and Pereira is that you can't afford to get hit by Pereira but can get hit against Rountree. If Pereira remains at light heavyweight, I think that you need to give Ulberg the shot and have Jiří fight one more.
          <br>
          <br>
          I think that Khalil needs to take some time off—no more fights in 2025—and come back to fight someone like Johnny Walker in Q2 2026. A matchup against Johnny Walker would be good, giving him an opportunity to right a wrong and start his last big title run in the UFC.

      <div class="fight" id="youssef-zalal-vs-josh-emmett">
        <h3>Youssef Zalal vs. Josh Emmett</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Armbar at 1:38 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>
          Good win for Youssef Zalal coming off a "fan-unfriendly" performance against Calvin Kattar at UFC Fight Night 251 earlier this year. Zalal increases his win streak to 5 in the UFC with this win and inches closer to a title fight on his second run in the UFC. There isn't much to say about the fight. Zalal got a takedown from the gun, and Emmett shows yet again that he cannot hang on the ground.
          <br>
          <br>
          I think that moving forward, Zalal is starting to look at big matchups in the stacked featherweight division and can start thinking about number one contender fights. If Lerone Murphy doesn't fight Volkanovski for the title next, I think that a matchup between Zalal and Murphy is the fight to make. Zalal made quick work of Emmett, while Murphy took him to a decision.
          <br>
          <br>
          As for Emmett, it's not looking as good. 1-4 in his last five and now 40 years of age. Sure, he didn't take any damage in this fight, but what is he fighting for at this point? He's lost too many of his last fights to be considered a legitimate gatekeeper and is far away from the title. I don't see much of a future for Emmett in the UFC at this point. Maybe take one more fight and try to end it on a win, but the recent history doesn't look good for him.

        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Rear Naked Choke at 1:46 Round 2 of 3, 6:46 Total</p>
        <p>
          Joe "Bodycam Off" Pyfer started the fight on the ground and ended it on the ground. Given his one-punch KO power, it seemed like an odd decision to go for a takedown in the first. Although struggling early, Pyfer showed that he is not a one-dimensional fighter and got the rear-naked choke in the second to finish Abus Magomedov.
          <br>
          <br>         
          It was an impressive win for Pyfer showing off his well-roundedness. Now on a three-fight win streak after suffering a setback from Jack Hermansson at UFC Fight Night: Hermansson vs. Pyfer, I think that it is time to give Pyfer a ranked opponent. I think Roman Kopylov or Marvin Vettori would be a good matchup for him.
          <br>
          <br>         
          I don't know what is next for Abus. Perhaps a matchup with Edmen Shahbazyan, who got a KO earlier on the card.

        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Elbows to Ground Punches at 1:41 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>
          Ateba Gautier sends Tre'ston Vines to the shadow realm! Who saw that one coming? Coming in as a -2000 favorite, there was only one way that this fight was going to go, which was a first-round TKO.
          <br>
          <br>  
          It is clear that Ateba has talent, but it is unclear how good he is. It's a common trend in MMA where prospects get good, highlight-reel wins on the regional scene and in their first UFC fights, but then struggle to rise up the rankings. Regardless, it's time to throw Ateba into deep waters and see if he "sinks or swims." I don't think it's time to give him a ranked opponent, but possibly a matchup with Kelvin Gastelum could be interesting.

        <p>
          It's always unfortunate when an opponent misses weight, but I don't think that it was much of a factor in this fight. With a lot of hype around Joo Sang Yoo, there were a lot of expectations for another highlight-reel KO in this one. Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be. A fairly forgettable first round was highlighted by Yoo "aura farming," effectively mocking Santos for the entire five minutes. Then, nearly immediately at the beginning of the second round, Santos connected and knocked Yoo out cold.
          <br>
          <br>  
          Joo Sang Yoo clearly has some things to work on. With his hands at his side for nearly the entire fight and his chin up in the air, it was only a matter of time before he paid for his mistakes.
          <br>
          <br>  
          Going forward, Yoo needs to go back to the drawing board and come into his next fight with a more focused energy. Santos, on the other hand, needs to get his nutrition under control and show that he can make weight in future fights.

        <h3>Jakub Wikłacz vs. Patchy Mix</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Split at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          Here we go, the talk of the prelims. Patchy continues to look extremely suspect on his UFC run. Now 0-2, he is in the hot seat, needing a victory in his next fight and risking being cut by the promotion.
          <br>
          <br> 
          The fight was nothing spectacular. Wikłacz came out and easily won the exchanges in the first to take the round. Patchy had a better showing in the second by bringing the fight to the ground into his realm and making it close. Patchy then clearly won the third.
          <br>
          <br> 
          Wikłacz then won the fight, which definitely was littered with controversy, with many fighters online saying that Patchy was robbed. In my opinion, I gave Wikłacz the second. He did more damage. It's that simple. I have started to view ground control as only a deciding factor if the round is effectively even besides that exchange. If you aren't causing damage, are you actually winning the fight?
          <br>
          <br> 
          Patchy's performance continues to hammer home the point that UFC fighters are a tier above other promotions, even other promotions' champions. The UFC has been putting too much spotlight on these free agents that had success in other promotions. The reality is that they aren't prepared for high-level competition in the UFC, and getting an immediate loss in the spotlight only leads to them losing the fanbase. RDR is a good example of a fighter that the UFC built properly. They first gave him Gerald Meerschaert and let him acclimate to the level. Now, we are talking about De Ridder in title elimination bouts. Patchy's UFC run has been completely mismanaged, and now he's not in a good position moving forward.
          <br>
          <br> 
          Patchy should take some time off to heal up and refocus. He should take on an unranked opponent who has had multiple fights in the UFC, so that there's more footage on the opponent, and should not fight on a PPV. Put him on a low-key Fight Night card that doesn't have as much buzz or media attention. This should lower the amount of pressure and allow him to focus on the fighting.

        <h3>Punahele Soriano vs. Nikolay Veretennikov</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          Punahele dominated the fight by employing a grappling approach. No one was too impressed by the fight, with Punahele also agreeing with this sentiment in post fight interviews. On a three fight win-streak, it'll be interesting to see where he lands next.

        <h3>Yana Santos vs. Macy Chiasson</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          Yana Santos came to fight and stole the first two rounds from Macy Chiasson with crisp striking. Chiasson battled back in the third, but it was a little too late and ultimately lost the bout 29-28.

        <h3>Farid Basharat vs. Chris Gutierrez</h3>

        <p>
          Farid Basharat came out and clearly won the first two rounds against Gutierrez. Gutierrez then got going late in the third, but could not get the finish that he needed. Seems like a classic trend with Gutierrez to lose a 2-1 decision but turn it on late.

        <h3>Ramiz Brahimaj vs. Austin Vanderford</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Guillotine Choke at 2:24 Round 2 of 3, 7:24 Total</p>
        <p>
          I don't remember too much about this fight, but winning via Guillotine seems suspect. The number of fighters that I have seen throw up unsuccessful Guillotines is baffling. To actually fall victim to one is concerning.

        <p>
          Veronica Hardy dominated the fight. This was one way traffic for three rounds.
