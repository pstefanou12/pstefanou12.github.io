      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>This weekend, the UFC returns to Madison Square Garden in New York City with an <strong>absolutely stacked</strong> card for UFC 322. To call this card "stacked" is not an understatement; it is easily the most compelling event the UFC has put on since UFC 300 last April.</p><br>

        <h4>The Main Event: Welterweight Gold is on the Line</h4>

        <p>In the main event, <strong>Islam Makhachev moves up to welterweight</strong> to challenge the newly minted champion, Jack Della Maddalena. Makhachev aims to fully step out of his mentor’s (Khabib Nurmagomedov) shadow and solidify himself as one of the best fighters to ever enter the sport. Della Maddalena, on the other hand, looks to not only defend his title but also avenge the two losses his fellow countryman, Alexander Volkanovski, suffered against the Dagestani phenom.</p><br>

        <h4>Co-Main Event: Double-Champ Aspirations</h4>

        <p>The co-main event features another "super fight": <strong>Valentina Shevchenko vs. Zhang Weili</strong>. Weili is moving up to the women’s flyweight division to challenge Shevchenko for double-champ status. Shevchenko is widely regarded as one of, if not <strong>the best</strong>, female fighters in MMA history, boasting 10 title-fight victories. Weili comes up from strawweight after decisively cleaning out the division, with her 6 title-fight wins all coming in dominant fashion.</p><br>

        <h4>Main Card Must-See TV</h4>

        <p>The rest of the main card is <strong>must-see TV</strong>, featuring the matchups Sean Brady vs. Michael Morales, Leon Edwards vs. Carlos Prates, and Beneil Dariush vs. Benoit St. Denis.</p><br>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Brady</strong> is the current number-one welterweight contender, coming off a dominant submission win over former champion Leon Edwards this past March.</li>
        <li><strong>Morales</strong> is a rising prospect from Ecuador, riding a flawless 18-0 record after a first-round TKO win over perennial top contender Gilbert Burns.</li>
        <li><strong>Leon Edwards</strong> is in a must-win situation, as the former champion is currently on a two-fight losing skid.</li>
        <li>Fan-favorite <strong>Carlos Prates</strong> recently bounced back from a loss to Ian Garry earlier this year and is looking to propel himself to the top of the division.</li>
        <li><strong>Beneil Dariush</strong> is fresh off a win over Renato Moicano in June and will look to continue his momentum after suffering two devastating KOs to the lightweight division’s top contenders.</li>
        <li><strong>Benoit St. Denis (BSD)</strong> is in a similar spot after a brutal 2024, suffering serious beatdowns from Dustin Poirier and Renato “Money” Moicano. BSD will look to extend his current win streak to three and prove he is a real player at 155.</li>
        </ul><br>

        <p>Even the prelims are packed with fascinating matchups: Bo Nickal vs. Rodolfo Vieira, Roman Kopylov vs. Gregory Rodrigues, Malcolm Wellmaker vs. Cody Haddon, and Erin Blanchfield vs. Tracy Cortez.</p><br>

      <h3 id="welterweights">What’s Going on with the Welterweights?</h3>

      <p>The UFC welterweight division is, without question, <strong>one of the most interesting divisions at the moment.</strong> It’s a weight class where the athletes are small enough to be quick and technical, yet big enough to deliver nasty knockouts. On top of this, the division is littered with top contenders all vying for a title shot. This weekend, we have two pivotal matchups within the division: Islam Makhachev vs. Jack Della Maddalena and Sean Brady vs. Michael Morales.</p><br>

      <p>I’ve already alluded to the significance of the main event title fight, but here are some additional stats:</p><br>

      <ul>
      <li><strong>Della Maddalena</strong> (18-2) is on an 18-fight win streak, having only lost his first two professional fights, with his last loss coming in 2016.</li>
      <li><strong>Islam Makhachev</strong> is on a 15-fight UFC win streak—one win away from tying Anderson Silva’s 16-win record—and will become the 11th fighter to achieve double-champ status if he wins. Islam has not lost since 2015.</li>
      </ul><br>

      <p>So, who’s going to win? I don’t know. But I will say this: <strong>+215 on Jack Della Maddalena seems insane.</strong> JDM has been drastically improving with each UFC outing. Following his UFC 299 performance against Gilbert Burns, he faced Belal Muhammad this spring. In the title fight against Muhammad, JDM showcased his improved grappling, effectively denying all of Muhammad’s wrestling advances. Now, let’s not forget, Belal and Islam are allegedly “brothers” and have trained together in Dagestan. I think JDM’s experience against Belal earlier this year will benefit him immensely, and Islam will struggle to take him down.</p><br>

      <p>Now, let’s take a look at Islam’s record. To start off, I don’t think the lightweight division is as good as people think. The top of the division is littered with a number of one-dimensional fighters like Dustin Poirier, Justin Gaethje, and Max Holloway. Because of this, Islam has not faced a high-level grappler in his reign. Sure, he fought Tsarukyan on the come up, but he struggled to win that match. Unfortunately, we didn’t get to see the rematch at UFC 311 this past January because Arman pulled out with a last-minute back injury, making it hard to assess how Islam fares against someone with equivalent grappling aptitude.</p><br>

      <p>Beyond that, Islam’s title reign has been filled with short-notice replacement opponents. Moicano fought Islam on 24 hours’ notice. Volkanovski fought him on 10 days’ notice. Even Poirier fought Islam on 6 weeks’ notice. When you also examine some of his title defenses, you see he went life-and-death with an out-of-his-prime Poirier and nearly got knocked out by Volkanovski in their first matchup. Even before his title fight, his biggest win was a first-round submission over Dan Hooker.</p><br>

      <p>Let’s also not forget that many of these fighters were <strong>previously featherweights</strong> and only moved up to lightweight after a career there. I don’t like this argument: “I was so drained cutting weight to 155 and feel stronger at welterweight.” If you were so drained at 155, why did you fight at that weight class? <strong>It’s because being big for your division is a massive advantage.</strong> Now, Islam is moving up to a weight class with fighters who are a minimum of 15 lbs heavier. There is a reason why there aren’t any double-champs in the lightweight and welterweight divisions.</p><br>

      <h4>The Welterweight Title Picture</h4>

      <p>Besides the title fight this weekend, there is a lot happening at welterweight in general. On the main card, we have two potential number-one contender matchups with Sean Brady vs. Michael Morales and Leon Edwards vs. Carlos Prates.</p><br>

      <p><strong>Sean Brady</strong> is getting the short end of the stick this weekend. Ultimately, he probably should be fighting for the title after his dominant win over former champion Leon Edwards, but he had to step aside for Islam, even though Islam had big matchups available at lightweight. Regardless, Brady is showing how game he is by taking on a surging contender in Morales this weekend. Needless to say, whoever wins that fight could easily be lining themselves up for a title shot sometime next year.</p><br>

      <p><strong>This is a must-win for Leon Edwards this weekend.</strong> Currently on a two-fight skid, a loss to Prates will essentially end the Brit’s career. Prates is a fan-favorite who delivers spectacular knockouts in most of his performances. This will be an interesting fight to see: will the former champion show that he’s still got it, or is the hype real, and Prates will reign supreme?</p><br>

      <p>With matchups like these, and the Belal Muhammad vs. Ian Garry matchup next weekend, <strong>there is a lot on the line</strong> for all of these welterweights. A stellar performance should almost guarantee a title shot, while a lackluster win will send you back to the drawing board.</p><br>

      <h4>Islam's Call-Outs: A Joke?</h4>

      <p>One thing that has been upsetting me this week is Islam consistently calling for a Kamaru Usman matchup next if he wins the title this weekend. With so much going on in the division, <strong>how can you possibly be calling out Usman? It’s honestly a joke.</strong> Kamaru is 1-3 in his last four fights and has fought once in the past two years. I really don’t understand it. There are killers vying for a title shot, but you are going to call out the 38-year-old sitting on the sidelines, crying for a title shot? I think it’s lame and super soft.</p><br>

      <p>Not only that, Islam is a guy who says things like, “I’ll fight anyone, wherever, whenever.” <strong>It’s just bullshit at this point.</strong> He only fights short-notice opponents when he’s had a full training camp and his opponent hasn’t, and he has been running from high-profile matchups like Ilia Topuria. If Usman gets a title shot next, given what’s going down at welterweight, it would be a serious stain on the sport.</p><br>


      <h3 id="women's-flyweights">Women’s Flyweights: Cleared Out</h3>
      <p>I don’t think there is much to say here because these divisions are so shallow, but the matchup between Valentina Shevchenko vs. Zhang Weili <strong>is must-see TV.</strong> Both are savages who have cleared out their respective divisions, and Zhang is moving to flyweight to vie for double-champ status. For Shevchenko, it’s been a somewhat rocky road as of late, and at 37, a loss this weekend will likely result in retirement.</p><br>

      <p>As for the other flyweight fight on the card, Blanchfield vs. Cortez is a high-profile matchup that could yield title-fight implications. It’s a shame for Blanchfield. Earlier this year, she had a fight fall through at the last minute against Maycee Barber, and a win here should get her a title shot or at least a title eliminator.</p><br>

      <p>However, <strong> is so undeserving of a shot up the rankings.</strong> To quote something I heard earlier today: “Tracy Cortez is a simp farmer.” She is. It’s as simple as that. She shows time and time again that she doesn’t have true championship aspirations and is extremely inactive. Her main event fight against Rose Namajunas was embarrassing, and I don’t think her win at UFC 317 against Viviane Araujo warrants such a high-profile matchup. I hope Blanchfield wins, but ultimately, given how women’s MMA goes, <strong>who really cares?</strong></p><br>

      <h3 id="bo-nickal-crypto">Bo Nickal is the Crypto of MMA</h3>
      <p><strong>Bo Nickal is the crypto of MMA. He is.</strong> Crypto is a technology that has been around for over a decade, and people still say it is “still too early” to tell the impact a distributed ledger yields. Similarly, after every Bo Nickal performance, grappling-based fighters and Dana White say, “He’s young in the sport and needs some work.” <strong>Bo Nickal is about to turn 30 years old and was violated by RDR in May.</strong> The time for development has passed. It’s time to perform and start living up to the hype that was given when he entered the UFC. Like, what’s the plan? He’ll be a champion when he’s 50? <strong>Come on now.</strong><p><br>

      <p>Nevertheless, Bo Nickal has nothing to gain and everything to lose this weekend. If he loses to Rodolfo Vieira, <strong>it’s the end of his career.</strong> It will be hard to find him winnable matchups at middleweight. If he wins, no one will care. They will just say that he was given a favorable matchup against an unranked opponent to bounce back after his RDR loss. It sounds harsh, but it’s true.</p><br>

      <p>I think Bo Nickal needs a finish this weekend, and I hope he gets it. There’s no hype for Vieira at the moment, so him beating Bo Nickal will really do nothing for the sport.</p><br>

      <h3 id="malcolm-wellmaker">Is Malcolm Wellmaker the Truth?</h3>
      <p>After landing three nasty first-round right-hook KOs—on the Contender Series and in his first two UFC fights—a lot of spotlight has been put on the budding bantamweight. The real question is whether he is as good as the UFC is making him out to be. Getting early KOs is a good sign as to whether you can be a top contender, but getting KOs over "cans" doesn't mean you will be a title challenger.</p><br>

      <p>This weekend will be an interesting test. The UFC is still trying to build Wellmaker and is giving him Cody Haddon, who is taking the fight on short notice. Still, Haddon is 8-1, so he could spoil the party.</p><br>

      <p><strong>Wellmaker needs a big performance this weekend</strong> to launch him into matchups against ranked opponents or those just outside the rankings. At 31 years old, the time is now. He can't afford to lose and can't afford to have a dull performance. I guess we will have to see what happens.</p><br>
     
      <h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
      <p>These are some of the major storylines at play this weekend at UFC 322. It should be a card to remember, so be sure to tune in to see what happens.</p><br>
