      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        UFC 325 marked a disappointing start to the UFC's new Paramount Plus era, delivering a night of forgettable action that failed to justify the promotion's 1.1 billion dollar annual broadcast deal. Headlined by an unnecessary rematch between <strong>Alexander Volkanovski</strong> and <strong>Diego Lopes</strong>, the card struggled to generate any memorable moments or compelling storylines, leaving fans questioning the direction of the sport's premier organization.
        <br><br>
        The main event encapsulated everything wrong with the evening. Despite <strong>Volkanovski</strong> successfully defending his featherweight title for the first time since July 2023, the fight was a tactical stalemate filled with feinting and hesitation. The 37-year-old champion fought conservatively, forcing <strong>Lopes</strong> to be the aggressor while offering little offensive output of his own. The rematch, which nobody asked for after their clear first encounter at UFC 314, did nothing to advance the division or create any excitement around the featherweight title picture.
        <br><br>
        The main card provided flashes of violence but lacked any lasting impact. <strong>Benoit Saint-Denis</strong> extended his winning streak to four with a brutal stoppage of <strong>Dan Hooker</strong>, raining down elbows from the crucifix position in a performance that established him as a legitimate lightweight contender. <strong>Mauricio Ruffy</strong> bounced back from his loss to Saint-Denis with an impressive knockout of elite striker <strong>Rafael Fiziev</strong>, though questions remain about whether his one-dimensional hunt for the kill shot will work against the division's best. The heavyweight clash between <strong>Tai Tuivasa</strong> and <strong>Tallison Teixeira</strong> went the distance but showcased two exhausted, poorly-conditioned fighters who looked nowhere near championship caliber.
        <br><br>
        The prelims were equally unremarkable, highlighted only by rising prospect <strong>Quillan Salkilld</strong> continuing his perfect UFC run with a first-round submission of <strong>Jamie Mullarkey</strong>. The Road to UFC tournament finals that opened the card failed to deliver any breakout stars, with all three finals producing decision wins or late comebacks rather than dominant performances that would excite fans about the UFC's newest signings.
        <br><br>
        Perhaps most concerning is the complete lack of direction in the promotion's marquee divisions. The featherweight title picture remains muddled, with deserving contenders like <strong>Movsar Evloev</strong> and <strong>Lerone Murphy</strong> continually passed over for less-compelling rematches. The lightweight division, despite having explosive matchups readily available, continues to see its best fighters matched illogically or held on the sidelines. The UFC's failure to book obvious must-see fights like <strong>Arman Tsarukyan</strong> vs. <strong>Ilia Topuria</strong>—the biggest fight they could possibly make right now—represents a stunning mismanagement of their most valuable assets.
        <br><br>
        The production quality also suffered under the new Paramount deal, with broadcasts missing key moments of the live action and failing to capture the atmosphere that has traditionally made UFC events special. The magic that once defined UFC pay-per-views feels increasingly absent, replaced by a paint-by-numbers approach that treats fans as guaranteed customers rather than passionate supporters who deserve compelling matchmaking and coherent storytelling.
        <br><br>
        UFC 325 represents everything wrong with the sport's current trajectory: unnecessary rematches, poor matchmaking, lack of promotional investment in storylines, and a complete absence of the high-stakes moments that make combat sports compelling. With the first quarter of 2026 on track to feature zero legitimate undisputed title fights under their new billion-dollar broadcast deal, the UFC must urgently reassess their approach before alienating the hardcore fanbase that has supported them through decades of growth.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Final Score: 6.2/10</strong>

        <h3>Alexander Volkanovski vs. Diego Lopes</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 1</p>
        <p>
          In an unnecessary and uninspiring rematch, <strong>Alexander Volkanovski</strong> successfully defended his featherweight title against <strong>Diego Lopes</strong>, securing his first title defense since July 2023 in a fight that did little to elevate either man's legacy. The 37-year-old Australian champion, fighting on home soil for the first time in his title reign, faced the 31-year-old Brazilian in a rematch that many believed should have gone to deserving contenders <strong>Movsar Evloev</strong> or <strong>Lerone Murphy</strong> instead.
          <br><br>
          The controversy surrounding this matchup stemmed from their clear first encounter at UFC 314 in April 2025, where <strong>Volkanovski</strong> reclaimed the vacant featherweight title for the third time with a unanimous decision victory. <strong>Lopes</strong>, despite scoring a knockdown in that fight, needed only a single win over <strong>Jean Silva</strong> in September to earn this immediate rematch—a luxury rarely afforded to fighters who lose title fights so decisively.
          <br><br>
          From the opening bell, both fighters showed extreme caution, with neither willing to engage meaningfully. The pattern established early would define all five rounds: excessive feinting, hand fighting to establish range, and brief exchanges followed by immediate clinching or disengagement. <strong>Volkanovski</strong> attempted multiple takedowns throughout the fight but struggled to hold <strong>Lopes</strong> down for any significant duration. When <strong>Volk</strong> did secure takedowns, <strong>Lopes</strong> demonstrated solid defensive grappling, quickly returning to his feet or forcing separations.
          <br><br>
          The striking exchanges, when they occurred, were equally unimpressive. <strong>Lopes</strong> found some success with calf kicks to <strong>Volkanovski's</strong> lead leg, but the champion had answers with counters of his own. In the second round, <strong>Lopes</strong> briefly threatened with a guillotine attempt after shooting for a takedown, but <strong>Volkanovski</strong> easily defended and reversed position. The third round saw <strong>Volkanovski</strong> land his most significant shots of the fight, momentarily stunning <strong>Lopes</strong> with combinations before the Brazilian recovered and continued his defensive shell.
          <br><br>
          Neither fighter showed urgency even as the championship rounds arrived. The fourth round was perhaps the least eventful of the entire contest, with both men seemingly content to let the judges decide the outcome. <strong>Volkanovski</strong> landed a groin strike that briefly halted action, but the restart brought no increase in aggression from either competitor. The final round saw <strong>Lopes</strong> desperately throw caution to the wind, attempting submissions including kimuras and armbars from the bottom, but <strong>Volkanovski</strong> easily defended and ended the fight in top position.
          <br><br>
          The unanimous decision for <strong>Volkanovski</strong> was never in doubt, but the manner of victory—forcing his opponent to try to take the belt rather than imposing his will—represented a disappointing performance from a champion known for his aggressive, high-volume striking. At 37 years old, coming off knockout losses to <strong>Islam Makhachev</strong> and <strong>Ilia Topuria</strong> before reclaiming his title, questions about <strong>Volkanovski's</strong> ability to maintain his championship form continue to mount.
          <br><br>
          For <strong>Lopes</strong>, the loss sends him tumbling back down the rankings after his brief flirtation with championship gold. A potential matchup with rising contender <strong>Youseff Zalal</strong> could make sense as his next step, though the Brazilian's stock has undeniably taken a hit after failing to threaten <strong>Volkanovski</strong> in either of their encounters. The featherweight division feels stagnant, with the UFC seemingly more interested in creating marketable matchups than honoring the rightful challengers who have earned their opportunities through wins over ranked competition.

        <h3>Benoit Saint-Denis vs. Dan Hooker</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Punches and Elbows From Full Mount at 4:45 Round 2 of 3, 9:45 Total</p>
        <p>
          In a clash between lightweight contenders seeking to establish themselves among the division's elite, <strong>Benoit Saint-Denis</strong> delivered a brutal statement performance, stopping <strong>Dan Hooker</strong> with a vicious ground-and-pound assault in the second round. The victory extended the Frenchman's winning streak to four fights and marked the biggest win of his UFC career, while simultaneously dealing a crushing blow to <strong>Hooker's</strong> championship aspirations.
          <br><br>
          Both fighters entered this matchup with compelling narratives. <strong>Saint-Denis</strong>, riding a three-fight finishing streak that included submissions of <strong>Kyle Prepolec</strong> and <strong>Mauricio Ruffy</strong> plus a devastating 16-second knockout of <strong>Beneil Dariush</strong> at UFC 322, had proven he belonged among the lightweight elite. <strong>Hooker</strong>, meanwhile, was coming off a submission loss to <strong>Arman Tsarukyan</strong> in November that snapped his own three-fight winning streak. The 35-year-old New Zealander, fighting close to home, was defending his #6 ranking on quick turnaround—his shortest time between fights since 2021.
          <br><br>
          From the opening bell, <strong>Saint-Denis</strong> immediately showed his intentions, aggressively pursuing takedowns. <strong>Hooker</strong> displayed excellent defensive awareness initially, defending the first attempt with a head kick and threatening guillotine chokes on subsequent entries. The Frenchman remained undeterred, and when he finally secured a judo throw to bring the fight to the canvas, he began to impose his suffocating top game.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Hooker</strong> found some success on the feet, landing effective teep kicks to <strong>Saint-Denis's</strong> body and showing flashes of his dangerous striking. However, every time the fight returned to the mat, <strong>BSD</strong> advanced position with frightening ease. In the first round alone, he moved to half guard and began landing brutal elbows to <strong>Hooker's</strong> head. The New Zealander showed his veteran savvy by threatening a kimura attempt, forcing an explosion to return to his feet, but the damage was already accumulating.
          <br><br>
          The second round began with both men trading recklessly on the feet, but <strong>Saint-Denis</strong> quickly dragged the fight back to his world. Once on the ground, he achieved a devastating crucifix position that allowed him to rain down unanswered elbows on <strong>Hooker's</strong> defenseless face. The Frenchman briefly attempted an arm triangle, which <strong>Hooker</strong> miraculously survived, but <strong>BSD</strong> showed remarkable fight IQ by abandoning the submission to return to his punishing ground strikes.
          <br><br>
          As <strong>Hooker's</strong> face became a crimson mask, <strong>Saint-Denis</strong> continued his relentless assault from mount and the crucifix, landing elbows and punches that opened horrific cuts and caused severe swelling. Despite <strong>Hooker's</strong> legendary toughness and refusal to quit, referee Herb Dean had no choice but to stop the fight at 4:45 of the second round, saving the veteran from further unnecessary punishment.
          <br><br>
          The victory represents a career-defining moment for <strong>Saint-Denis</strong>, who called out legitimate contenders in his post-fight interview rather than seeking money fights. He mentioned <strong>Max Holloway</strong>, <strong>Charles Oliveira</strong>, <strong>Arman Tsarukyan</strong>, <strong>Justin Gaethje</strong>, and even <strong>Ilia Topuria</strong> as potential opponents—a refreshing approach that demonstrates his desire to fight the best regardless of promotional convenience. A number one contender fight against <strong>Tsarukyan</strong> makes the most sense, with the winner earning a shot at the undisputed lightweight championship.
          <br><br>
          For <strong>Hooker</strong>, this devastating loss—his second consecutive defeat and fourth in his last six fights—raises serious questions about his future at the elite level. At 35 years old, with his face severely damaged and his ranking likely to plummet, the New Zealander faces an uncertain path forward. A step back in competition against fighters like <strong>Rafael Fiziev</strong> or <strong>Joel Alvarez</strong> could make sense, though <strong>Hooker</strong> may need significant time away to heal both physically and mentally from this brutal defeat. His recent comments about resigning himself to never fighting for UFC gold, though later walked back, may prove prophetic if he cannot rediscover the form that once made him a perennial contender.

      <div class="fight" id="mauricio-ruffy-vs-rafael-fiziev">
        <h3>Mauricio Ruffy vs. Rafael Fiziev</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Punches at 4:30 Round 2 of 3, 9:30 Total</p>
        <p>
          In a striker versus striker showdown that promised fireworks, <strong>Mauricio Ruffy</strong> rebounded from his submission loss to <strong>Benoit Saint-Denis</strong> by scoring a second-round knockout over elite Muay Thai practitioner <strong>Rafael Fiziev</strong>. The Brazilian's knockout power—which earned him MMA Junkie's 2025 Knockout of the Year for his finish of <strong>King Green</strong>—proved too much for the technically superior but smaller <strong>Fiziev</strong>, though questions remain about <strong>Ruffy's</strong> one-dimensional approach.
          <br><br>
          The matchup represented a critical juncture for both fighters. <strong>Ruffy</strong>, having left The Fighting Nerds camp to train with <strong>Alexander Volkanovski's</strong> team in Australia and Thailand, was looking to prove his grappling deficiencies had been addressed while maintaining his devastating knockout ability. Eleven of his twelve career wins had come by knockout, making him one of the most dangerous finishers in the lightweight division. <strong>Fiziev</strong>, meanwhile, was riding a one-fight winning streak after snapping a brutal three-fight skid with a decision over <strong>Ignacio Bahamondes</strong> in June 2025. The elite striker, who carries a 39-8 professional Muay Thai record, needed an impressive performance to prove he still belonged among the lightweight elite at 32 years old.
          <br><br>
          The first round showcased the clear speed advantage possessed by <strong>Fiziev</strong>, whose reflexes and technical striking looked sharper than <strong>Ruffy's</strong> more plodding, power-based approach. <strong>Fiziev</strong> walked down the taller Brazilian, even attempting a takedown against the fence—a surprising tactical choice given his striking pedigree. The round largely belonged to <strong>Fiziev</strong>, who found success with his combinations while <strong>Ruffy</strong> spent most of the frame searching for the perfect kill shot. A late head kick and jab from <strong>Ruffy</strong> briefly shook <strong>Fiziev</strong>, but the round ended with the smaller fighter firmly in control.
          <br><br>
          The second round began with <strong>Ruffy</strong> showing much more confidence and activity. He effectively utilized his jab while fighting off the back foot, a marked improvement from his typical aggressive style. <strong>Ruffy</strong> began systematically attacking <strong>Fiziev's</strong> lead leg with sharp calf kicks, and the damage accumulated quickly. <strong>Fiziev</strong> attempted a spinning back kick that missed, causing him to lose his balance slightly—a sign that the leg kicks were already compromising his movement.
          <br><br>
          As <strong>Fiziev's</strong> mobility decreased, <strong>Ruffy</strong> sensed the opportunity. The Brazilian uncorked a picture-perfect right hand that caught <strong>Fiziev</strong> flush on the chin, sending him crashing to the canvas. <strong>Ruffy</strong> immediately followed his opponent to the ground, and though <strong>Fiziev</strong> briefly returned to his feet, he was badly hurt. <strong>Ruffy</strong> poured on the pressure with follow-up strikes, forcing the referee to stop the contest at 4:30 of the second round.
          <br><br>
          The knockout victory was <strong>Ruffy's</strong> twelfth by stoppage and continued his pattern of spectacular finishes, but it also highlighted the concerns about his fighting style. Throughout both rounds, <strong>Ruffy</strong> appeared content to simply search for the one-shot knockout rather than building combinations or implementing a varied attack. While his range and power proved too much for <strong>Fiziev</strong>, legitimate questions remain about whether this approach will succeed against larger, more well-rounded lightweight contenders like <strong>Dan Hooker</strong>, who possesses both the size and technical skills to exploit <strong>Ruffy's</strong> one-dimensional game.
          <br><br>
          In his post-fight interview, <strong>Ruffy</strong> called out <strong>Conor McGregor</strong>, <strong>Paddy Pimblett</strong>, and <strong>Michael Chandler</strong>—all names that make sense from a promotional standpoint but do little to prove his legitimacy against the division's true contenders. More interesting matchups exist with fighters ranked below him, such as <strong>Fares Ziam</strong> or <strong>Joel Alvarez</strong>, who could test whether <strong>Ruffy's</strong> improved jab and movement are sustainable over fifteen minutes against hungry, well-rounded opponents.
          <br><br>
          For <strong>Fiziev</strong>, the loss represents another devastating setback in what has become a difficult stretch of his career. Now 32 years old with inconsistent performances against top competition, he will need to fight his way back down the rankings in his next outing. The knockout also raises concerns about whether his time competing at the highest levels of the sport may be nearing its end, as the speed and technical advantages he once possessed seemed diminished against <strong>Ruffy's</strong> more basic but effective approach.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="fight" id="tallison-teixeira-vs-tai-tuivasa">
        <h3>Tallison Teixeira vs. Tai Tuivasa</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          In a heavyweight clash that showcased everything wrong with the division's current state, <strong>Tallison Teixeira</strong> earned a unanimous decision over fan-favorite <strong>Tai Tuivasa</strong> in a fight that exposed severe conditioning and technical deficiencies from both men. The victory snapped <strong>Teixeira's</strong> one-fight losing streak while extending <strong>Tuivasa's</strong> nightmarish skid to six consecutive defeats—a career-ending run that almost certainly spells the end of the Australian's UFC tenure.
          <br><br>
          The matchup represented a classic rising prospect versus falling veteran scenario, though neither fighter appeared to be operating at anything close to championship level. <strong>Teixeira</strong>, the 26-year-old Brazilian standing 6'7" with an 83-inch reach, was coming off a controversial 35-second knockout loss to <strong>Derrick Lewis</strong> that many felt was an early stoppage. The defeat had snapped his UFC debut win over <strong>Junior Tafa</strong>—ironically also competing on this card—and he sought to prove that loss was merely a blip in his development. <strong>Tuivasa</strong>, meanwhile, entered in the midst of a career crisis, having ballooned to 330 pounds during a year-long layoff after losing five straight fights. Despite weighing in at 265.5 pounds looking severely drained, the 32-year-old Australian fan favorite was fighting for his UFC life on home soil.
          <br><br>
          The first round immediately established the pattern that would define the entire contest. <strong>Teixeira</strong> utilized his significant size advantage to secure early takedowns, bringing <strong>Tuivasa</strong> to the canvas with relative ease. Once on the ground, the Brazilian established back control and began landing ground-and-pound, though <strong>Tai</strong> showed veteran savvy by controlling the wrists to minimize damage. <strong>Teixeira</strong> threatened with a rear-naked choke but couldn't secure the proper angle, and when <strong>Tuivasa</strong> finally returned to his feet, <strong>Teixeira</strong> immediately tripped him back to the canvas. The round ended with more positional grappling and minimal damage inflicted by either man.
          <br><br>
          The second round began on the feet with both men swinging wildly in the center of the octagon. <strong>Tuivasa</strong> found brief success with calf kicks that targeted <strong>Teixeira's</strong> lead leg, but the Brazilian landed a big combination that stunned <strong>Tai</strong> when his hands dropped. <strong>Teixeira</strong> immediately followed up with a takedown, and despite <strong>Tuivasa's</strong> sprawl attempt, dragged the fight back to the mat. The Brazilian advanced to mount and then took the back again, landing strikes to the side of <strong>Tuivasa's</strong> head while the Australian showed no urgency to improve his position or escape. The round ended with <strong>Teixeira</strong> raining down punches from dominant positions, though the damage output remained surprisingly low for such advantageous positioning.
          <br><br>
          By the third round, both fighters looked completely exhausted. <strong>Teixeira</strong> appeared uncoordinated and gassed, while <strong>Tuivasa</strong> moved like a man carrying extra weight in a sauna. When <strong>Teixeira</strong> shot for an early takedown, <strong>Tuivasa</strong> actually managed to defend it—a minor victory that proved meaningless as his own conditioning was equally compromised. The two heavyweights disengaged and began slugging at each other, with <strong>Tuivasa</strong> landing several big shots that wobbled <strong>Teixeira</strong>. For a brief moment, it appeared the Australian might pull off a miracle comeback finish. Instead, <strong>Tuivasa's</strong> exhaustion led him to clinch rather than press his advantage, allowing <strong>Teixeira</strong> to recover. The Brazilian landed a big knee to the body late, but neither man could muster any finishing instinct in the final minute.
          <br><br>
          The unanimous decision for <strong>Teixeira</strong> was never in doubt, but the manner of victory raised more questions than it answered about his prospects at heavyweight. Despite possessing impressive physical attributes—his 6'7" frame and 83-inch reach are rare in any division—his uncoordinated movement, terrible conditioning, and inability to finish an exhausted, diminished <strong>Tuivasa</strong> suggest he will struggle mightily against legitimate contenders. Fighters like <strong>Josh Hokit</strong> or anyone with basic cardio and technical striking would likely dominate him based on this performance.
          <br><br>
          For <strong>Tuivasa</strong>, the loss almost certainly marks the end of his UFC career. Six consecutive defeats—four by finish—represents an insurmountable hole from which few fighters recover. The Australian's complete lack of strategy, combined with his atrocious conditioning and inability to stop takedowns, suggests he has nothing left to offer at this level. His famous "shoey" celebrations and fan-favorite status may delay the inevitable, but this performance made clear that <strong>Tuivasa</strong> no longer belongs competing against even mid-tier UFC heavyweights. The heavyweight division may be shallow, but it's not shallow enough to justify keeping a fighter on a six-fight skid who showed zero improvement or game-planning in what should have been a must-win situation.

      <div class="fight" id="quillan-salkilld-vs-jamie-mullarkey">
        <h3>Quillan Salkilld vs. Jamie Mullarkey</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Rear Naked Choke at 3:02 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>
          In the final fight of the main card, rising Australian prospect <strong>Quillan Salkilld</strong> maintained his perfect UFC record with a dominant first-round submission of veteran <strong>Jamie Mullarkey</strong>, extending his winning streak to ten fights and further cementing his status as one of the lightweight division's most exciting young talents. The performance showcased <strong>Salkilld's</strong> complete skill set, though his showboating antics during the finish raised concerns about his focus against future elite competition.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Salkilld</strong> entered this all-Australian affair as a massive -1000 favorite, riding unprecedented momentum as 2025's breakout UFC rookie. His resume included winning "Debut of the Year" honors with a 19-second knockout of <strong>Anshul Jubli</strong> at UFC 312 and a viral head-kick knockout of <strong>Nasrat Haqparast</strong> at UFC 321 in October—a finish so violent it broke his foot on impact, though he recovered in time for this bout. The UFC had heavily promoted the 10-1 fighter, and his bold proclamations that he's "built different" and expects to be in title contention soon had generated significant buzz.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Mullarkey</strong>, meanwhile, was supposed to be facing <strong>Rongzhu</strong> before the short-notice change brought him <strong>Salkilld</strong> instead. The 31-year-old veteran, sporting an 18-8 overall record, was coming off a win over <strong>Rolando Bedoya</strong> that had snapped his own losing streak. Fighting on home soil, <strong>Mullarkey</strong> represented a step up in competition for <strong>Salkilld</strong>—an experienced fighter who could potentially expose any holes in the prospect's game.
          <br><br>
          From the opening bell, <strong>Salkilld</strong> immediately shot for a takedown, showing his willingness to test his grappling against the veteran. <strong>Mullarkey</strong> initially defended well, getting back to his feet against the cage and reversing position in the clinch. The veteran even managed to get <strong>Salkilld</strong> down briefly, but the prospect returned to his feet with ease, demonstrating the scrambling ability that makes him so dangerous.
          <br><br>
          The fight's decisive moment came when <strong>Mullarkey</strong> attempted to hold <strong>Salkilld</strong> against the fence in the clinch. The prospect explosively reversed position, throwing <strong>Mullarkey</strong> to the ground with authority. Once on top, <strong>Salkilld's</strong> elite grappling took over. He quickly transitioned to <strong>Mullarkey's</strong> back, securing both hooks with practiced precision. <strong>Mullarkey</strong> had no answer for the positional control, and <strong>Salkilld</strong> smoothly locked in a neck crank that forced the veteran to tap at 3:02 of the first round.
          <br><br>
          While the finish was impressive, <strong>Salkilld's</strong> behavior during the submission raised red flags. He stuck out his tongue while securing the choke, engaging in what can only be described as "aura farming"—showboating for highlights rather than focusing solely on finishing the fight. Against a mid-level veteran like <strong>Mullarkey</strong>, such antics are relatively harmless. However, against the lightweight division's elite, this lack of complete focus could prove costly. When fighting the best of the best, every second of divided attention can be exploited, and <strong>Salkilld</strong> will need to mature his approach if he hopes to reach the championship level he claims is his destiny.
          <br><br>
          The victory improves <strong>Salkilld's</strong> UFC record to a perfect 3-0 with two finishes and earns him a significant step up in competition for his next outing. A matchup with a top-15 ranked opponent makes sense, as the UFC will want to test whether his complete skill set—he has proven equally dangerous on the feet and on the ground—can hold up against established contenders. Potential opponents like <strong>Renato Moicano</strong>, <strong>Jalin Turner</strong>, or <strong>Drew Dober</strong> would provide legitimate tests while keeping him away from the division's true killers until he demonstrates he can maintain focus and execute game plans without the unnecessary theatrics.
          <br><br>
          For <strong>Mullarkey</strong>, the loss drops him to 1-3 in his last four fights and raises serious questions about his UFC future. At 31 years old, with his ground game repeatedly exposed against quality grapplers, he may find himself on the chopping block if he can't string together wins in his next opportunity. The veteran showed alertness on the feet to avoid <strong>Salkilld's</strong> knockout power, but his inability to defend the takedown or escape from bottom position made the fight's outcome inevitable once it hit the mat.

        <h3>Billy Elekana vs. Junior Tafa</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Rear Naked Choke at 3:18 Round 2 of 3, 8:18 Total</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Billy Elekana</strong> extended his winning streak to three fights with a second-round submission of <strong>Junior Tafa</strong>, handing the Australian his second consecutive loss since moving down to light heavyweight. The finish came after a dramatic momentum shift that saw <strong>Tafa</strong> dominate early before getting knocked out on the feet and submitted on the ground.
          <br><br>
          The fight began with <strong>Elekana</strong> advancing behind teep kicks, using them to control distance and set up his striking. However, <strong>Tafa</strong> quickly found his mark with a devastating overhand right that dropped <strong>Elekana</strong> to the canvas. Somehow, <strong>Elekana</strong> survived the onslaught and returned to his feet, showing the resilience that has defined his UFC run. As the round progressed, <strong>Tafa</strong> pressed his advantage, getting <strong>Elekana</strong> against the cage and landing heavy shots that threatened to end the fight. The Australian landed another big right hook late in the frame that had <strong>Elekana</strong> in serious trouble heading into the break.
          <br><br>
          The second round brought a complete reversal of fortune. <strong>Elekana</strong> landed a perfectly-timed right hook that stunned <strong>Tafa</strong>, leaving him visibly hurt and out on his feet. Rather than allowing his opponent to recover, <strong>Elekana</strong> immediately shot for a takedown and dragged the compromised <strong>Tafa</strong> to the canvas. Once the fight hit the mat, it was over. <strong>Elekana</strong> quickly advanced to <strong>Tafa's</strong> back, and though <strong>Tafa</strong> attempted to rotate to escape, he only succeeded in giving up mount. <strong>Elekana</strong> transitioned back to the back, locked in a body triangle, and sank in the rear-naked choke at 3:18 of the second round.
          <br><br>
          The victory was particularly impressive given how badly <strong>Elekana</strong> was hurt in the opening round. His ability to survive <strong>Tafa's</strong> power and come back to finish the fight demonstrated championship-level heart and composure. However, <strong>Elekana's</strong> defensive boxing remains a glaring concern. He absorbed numerous clean shots in the first round that could have ended the fight against more technical strikers. If matched against someone like <strong>Alex Pereira</strong> or any elite light heavyweight with precision striking, those defensive lapses would likely result in a knockout loss.
          <br><br>
          For <strong>Junior Tafa</strong>, the defeat marks his fourth loss in his last five fights and suggests his move to light heavyweight has not solved his UFC struggles. Now 6-4 in the promotion and 1-2 since dropping from heavyweight, <strong>Tafa</strong> appears to lack both the cardio to compete for fifteen minutes with lighter, faster opponents and the one-punch knockout power that made him dangerous at heavyweight. At this trajectory, his UFC future looks increasingly uncertain unless he can make significant improvements to his gas tank and overall game.

      <div class="fight" id="cam-rowston-vs-cody-brundage">
        <h3>Cam Rowston vs. Cody Brundage</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Punches From Back Mount at 4:08 Round 2 of 3, 9:08 Total</p>
        <p>
          Australian prospect <strong>Cam Rowston</strong> scored a second-round TKO over <strong>Cody Brundage</strong>, though the finish took longer than expected against a fighter who has repeatedly proven he doesn't belong at the UFC level. The victory extended <strong>Rowston's</strong> momentum following his impressive UFC debut knockout but raised questions about why it required nearly two full rounds to dismantle an opponent with such glaring deficiencies.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Rowston</strong> entered as a massive -360 favorite, riding high off his spectacular first-round knockout of <strong>Andre Petroski</strong> in his UFC debut this past September. The 31-year-old "Battle Giraffe" had successfully rebounded from a grappling-heavy loss to <strong>Torrez Finney</strong> on the Contender Series over a year ago, earning his spot after winning his second appearance on the show against <strong>Brandon Holmes</strong>. Fighting on home soil with serious momentum behind him, <strong>Rowston</strong> was expected to make quick work of <strong>Brundage</strong>.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Brundage</strong>, meanwhile, entered the fight as one of the UFC's most controversial roster members. His official UFC record of 5-6-2 was misleading—it realistically should be 4-9 if not for a series of fortunate disqualifications and no-contests that saved him from losses. His TKO defeat to <strong>Mansur Abdul Malik</strong> was overturned to a no-contest after an accidental headbutt. His fight with <strong>Abdul Razak Alhassan</strong> ended in a no-contest due to a back-of-the-head shot. His fight with <strong>Jacob Malkoun</strong> (also on this card) resulted in a disqualification win due to illegal strikes. The American's actual competitive performances suggested he was nowhere near UFC caliber, making him a puzzling continued presence on the roster.
          <br><br>
          The first round saw <strong>Brundage</strong> implement a workable if unimpressive game plan, moving forward and attempting to clinch <strong>Rowston</strong> against the cage. <strong>Rowston's</strong> significant reach advantage—one of the most pronounced size mismatches on the card—became immediately apparent as <strong>Brundage</strong> struggled to cover the vast distance needed to land strikes. <strong>Rowston</strong> landed some effective knees to <strong>Brundage's</strong> head in the clinch and connected with a nice 1-2 combination against the cage, though he also left himself open for a groin shot that briefly stopped the action. The round was competitive primarily because <strong>Rowston</strong> failed to capitalize on his physical advantages.
          <br><br>
          The second round began with minimal action from both men, but <strong>Rowston</strong> eventually secured a takedown and immediately took <strong>Brundage's</strong> back. Once in position, the Australian began raining down devastating ground-and-pound from back mount. <strong>Brundage</strong>, showing the defensive inadequacies that have plagued his entire UFC run, offered no meaningful resistance as <strong>Rowston's</strong> punches accumulated. The referee had no choice but to stop the fight at 4:08 of the second round, mercifully ending <strong>Brundage's</strong> suffering and likely his UFC career.
          <br><br>
          While <strong>Rowston</strong> got the finish, the performance was far from impressive. Taking nearly two full rounds to dismantle <strong>Cody Brundage</strong>—a fighter who has never demonstrated UFC-level skills—suggests <strong>Rowston</strong> needs significant improvements before facing legitimate middleweight competition. His next fight should feature a considerable step up in opposition to determine whether he's a genuine prospect or simply another regional fighter who looks good against bottom-tier talent.
          <br><br>
          For <strong>Brundage</strong>, this loss should finally signal the end of his UFC tenure. The organization has given him far more opportunities than his performances warranted, largely due to controversial endings that artificially inflated his record. At this point, keeping him on the roster would be a disservice to both him and the fans who deserve to see actual UFC-caliber middleweights competing. His departure would free up a roster spot for a hungrier, more skilled prospect deserving of the opportunity.

      <div class="fight" id="jacob-malkoun-vs-torrez-finney">
        <h3>Jacob Malkoun vs. Torrez Finney</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          In a dominant performance that exposed the limitations of an overhyped prospect, <strong>Jacob Malkoun</strong> thoroughly outclassed previously undefeated <strong>Torrez Finney</strong> over three one-sided rounds. The Australian "Mamba," fighting at home, used his superior striking and reach advantage to systematically break down "The Punisher," potentially ending the hype train that had surrounded the grappling specialist since his controversial path to the UFC.
          <br><br>
          The matchup represented a significant test for both fighters, though for vastly different reasons. <strong>Malkoun</strong>, sporting an 8-3 record, had struggled with inactivity, failing to compete at all in 2025 and fighting only once each in 2023 and 2024. Coming off a single win against <strong>Brendan Allen</strong>, the unranked fighter needed an impressive performance to prove he deserved continued opportunities despite his lack of cage time. <strong>Finney</strong>, meanwhile, entered with tremendous hype after going 11-0 to start his career, though that path to the UFC raised eyebrows. He had been forced to win three separate bouts on Dana White's Contender Series before finally earning a contract—a clear indication that Dana White harbored serious doubts about his limited skill set despite the perfect record.
          <br><br>
          Those doubts proved prophetic in <strong>Finney's</strong> UFC debut, where he barely squeaked past <strong>Robert Valentin</strong> in a decision that many felt should have gone the other way. The fight exposed <strong>Finney's</strong> glaring hole: his complete lack of striking ability. Without functional boxing or kickboxing to set up his takedowns, <strong>Finney</strong> became predictable and one-dimensional. Against <strong>Malkoun's</strong> superior reach and technical striking, those deficiencies would prove insurmountable.
          <br><br>
          From the opening bell, <strong>Malkoun</strong> established his jab and used his range to keep <strong>Finney</strong> at bay. The undefeated prospect tried desperately to close distance for takedowns, but his small frame and lack of reach made every entry dangerous. When <strong>Finney</strong> did explode forward with punches, <strong>Malkoun</strong> calmly backed him up against the cage and began landing heavy strikes that visibly hurt the smaller fighter. <strong>Finney</strong> attempted multiple takedowns throughout the first round, but <strong>Malkoun</strong> defended them with relative ease, maintaining his preferred distance and continuing to piece up his opponent with jabs and combinations.
          <br><br>
          The second round saw <strong>Malkoun</strong> increase his aggression, landing big strikes that continued to damage <strong>Finney's</strong> face. A perfectly-timed jab knocked <strong>Finney</strong> down, and <strong>Malkoun</strong> immediately followed him to the canvas. They ended up against the cage with <strong>Malkoun</strong> in top position, landing shots to <strong>Finney's</strong> head while the prospect held on for survival. In the final seconds of the round, <strong>Malkoun</strong> secured a neck crank that had <strong>Finney</strong> in serious danger, but the bell saved him from a submission finish.
          <br><br>
          By the third round, <strong>Finney</strong> was visibly damaged—his face busted up, his knee compromised from the accumulated punishment. <strong>Malkoun</strong> continued imposing his game plan at will, mixing in more grappling to wear down the exhausted prospect. When <strong>Finney</strong> attempted his trademark takedowns, <strong>Malkoun</strong> easily stuffed them and continued his dominance both on the feet and in the clinch. The final bell brought a merciful end to <strong>Finney's</strong> suffering, with all three judges awarding <strong>Malkoun</strong> a clear unanimous decision.
          <br><br>
          The victory represents an important bounce-back for <strong>Malkoun</strong> after his extended period of inactivity. His technical striking, improved takedown defense, and ability to maintain composure against an aggressive wrestler suggest he deserves continued opportunities in the UFC's middleweight division. A matchup against a fringe-ranked opponent would make sense as his next step.
          <br><br>
          For <strong>Torrez Finney</strong>, the defeat may signal the end of his UFC career. His one-dimensional grappling simply doesn't work when opponents can keep him at range with superior striking and reach. Without developing functional stand-up skills, he cannot create the opportunities needed to implement his ground game against competent UFC-level fighters. The extensive damage to his face and knee from this beating, combined with his now 1-1 UFC record after barely winning his debut, suggests he may be on the chopping block. Unless he makes dramatic improvements to his striking in his next camp, <strong>Finney</strong> will continue to struggle against anyone with basic distance management and takedown defense.

      <div class="fight" id="jonathan-micallef-vs-oban-elliott">
        <h3>Jonathan Micallef vs. Oban Elliott</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Technical (Rear Naked Choke) at 3:31 Round 2 of 3, 8:31 Total</p>
        <p>
          In a clash of strikers that evolved into a grappling showcase, Australian prospect <strong>Jonathan Micallef</strong> submitted Welsh veteran <strong>Oban Elliott</strong> with a second-round rear-naked choke, avenging his teammate's loss while simultaneously exposing catastrophic holes in <strong>Elliott's</strong> ground game for the second consecutive fight. The submission victory improved <strong>Micallef's</strong> record to 9-1 and positioned him for a significant step up in the featherweight division.
          <br><br>
          The fight had been originally scheduled for UFC Fight Night: Ulberg vs. Reyes in September 2025 but was cancelled just 48 hours before the event when <strong>Elliott</strong> withdrew due to illness. Both fighters entered with something to prove and near pick 'em odds that suggested a competitive affair. <strong>Micallef</strong>, ranked #63 and riding momentum from his UFC debut decision over <strong>Kevin Jousset</strong> in February 2025, had generated significant hype on the regional scene and sought to build a winning streak. <strong>Elliott</strong>, ranked #51 and sporting a 12-3 record with a 3-1 UFC mark, desperately needed to bounce back from a devastating grappling loss to <strong>Seok Hyeon Ko</strong> in his previous outing—a defeat where he was completely dominated from opening bell to finish.
          <br><br>
          The first round began with <strong>Elliott</strong> immediately showcasing his grappling intentions, taking <strong>Micallef</strong> to the ground almost immediately and advancing to mount. However, <strong>Micallef</strong> demonstrated solid defensive awareness, quickly returning to his feet and separating. When <strong>Micallef</strong> threw a calf kick and slipped to the canvas, he bounced right back up, showing the scrambling ability that would prove crucial later. <strong>Elliott</strong> was the more aggressive fighter, advancing forward and attempting to impose his will through volume striking and clinch work against the cage. A big left hand from <strong>Micallef</strong> briefly dropped <strong>Elliott</strong>, but "The Welsh Gangster" recovered immediately and continued pressing forward with clinch attempts. By the end of the round, <strong>Micallef</strong> had opened a significant cut over his right eye, though he continued landing powerful knees to <strong>Elliott's</strong> thigh in the clinch.
          <br><br>
          The second round continued with <strong>Elliott</strong> remaining active, throwing head kicks, 1-2 combinations, and maintaining forward pressure. A big sequence pushed <strong>Micallef</strong> back against the cage, and the two men became tangled up in the clinch. This proved to be the fight's decisive moment. <strong>Micallef</strong> was able to drag <strong>Elliott</strong> to the ground, and once the fight hit the mat, the Welsh fighter's complete lack of defensive grappling was brutally exposed. <strong>Micallef</strong> took his back with both hooks in with shocking ease, encountering virtually no resistance from <strong>Elliott</strong>. The Australian locked in a rear-naked choke and <strong>Elliott</strong> went to sleep at 3:31 of the second round.
          <br><br>
          The finish told two very different stories about each fighter's development. On the feet, <strong>Elliott</strong> clearly held the advantage, applying consistent pressure and landing the cleaner, more varied strikes. However, his ground game—or complete absence thereof—cost him another fight. This marked the second consecutive bout where <strong>Elliott's</strong> grappling deficiencies proved catastrophic. There's simply nothing there; no defensive positioning, no submission defense, no ability to create scrambles or return to his feet once a competent grappler establishes position. Against <strong>Ko</strong> and now <strong>Micallef</strong>, <strong>Elliott</strong> looked like a white belt being mauled by purple belts.
          <br><br>
          For <strong>Micallef</strong>, the victory was impressive from a grappling perspective but concerning from a striking standpoint. His stand-up looked unnatural and disjointed, lacking the fluid combination work needed to compete with elite featherweights. Without improving his striking, he'll be forced to rely solely on his ground game—a dangerous proposition against well-rounded UFC fighters who can defend takedowns and keep the fight standing. The cut over his eye also raises questions about his durability against heavy strikers.
          <br><br>
          Moving forward, <strong>Micallef</strong> should receive a ranked opponent to test whether his grappling excellence can overcome his striking deficiencies at the next level. For <strong>Elliott</strong>, this loss drops him to 3-2 in the UFC and raises serious concerns about his future in the promotion. Unless he dedicates significant time to developing even basic defensive grappling—learning how to defend his back, escape inferior positions, and survive submissions—he will continue to be submitted by anyone with competent ground skills. His striking prowess means nothing if he cannot keep fights standing, and two consecutive grappling-based losses suggest he may need to return to regional competition to address these glaring holes before competing at the UFC level again.

      <div class="fight" id="kaan-ofli-vs-yizha">
        <h3>Kaan Ofli vs. Yizha</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Majority at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          In a controversial bantamweight clash that exposed fundamental flaws in MMA's scoring criteria, <strong>Kaan Ofli</strong> escaped with a majority decision victory over <strong>Yizha</strong> despite suffering a devastating second-round onslaught that nearly ended the fight. The result sparked immediate debate about whether cage control and takedown attempts should outweigh significant damage, with many observers believing <strong>Yizha</strong> deserved the victory.
          <br><br>
          The matchup featured contrasting career trajectories and experience levels. <strong>Ofli</strong>, the Turkish fighter nicknamed "Genghis" with a 12-4-1 record and ranked #52, was a prospect from The Ultimate Fighter 2024 who had started his UFC career with two consecutive losses before rebounding with a win over <strong>Ricardo Ramos</strong> in October. The +170 underdog entered looking to build on that momentum and prove he belonged among the division's rising talents. <strong>Yizha</strong>, the heavily-favored Chinese fighter at -210 despite being ranked lower at #57, brought an impressive 26-5 record and vastly more professional experience—31 total fights compared to <strong>Ofli's</strong> 17. Currently 1-1 in the UFC following a win over <strong>Westin Wilson</strong> last August, <strong>Yizha</strong> sought to establish himself as a legitimate bantamweight threat.
          <br><br>
          The first round saw <strong>Ofli</strong> immediately implement his grappling-heavy game plan, shooting for takedowns early and often. <strong>Yizha</strong> initially defended well, circling away from the first attempt and shaking off the pressure. However, <strong>Ofli</strong> persisted, eventually trapping <strong>Yizha</strong> against the cage and dragging him to the canvas. Once on top, <strong>Ofli</strong> began landing ground-and-pound while <strong>Yizha</strong> worked desperately to return to his feet. The Turkish fighter showed solid top control, continually bringing <strong>Yizha</strong> back to the mat whenever he attempted to stand. <strong>Ofli</strong> also landed significant shots in the clinch before the fighters separated and returned to the center. There, <strong>Ofli</strong> connected with a big right hand that stunned <strong>Yizha</strong>, though the Chinese fighter quickly recovered and countered with his own left hook. Late in the round, <strong>Yizha</strong> landed a vicious left hook against the cage that nearly dropped <strong>Ofli</strong>, providing a preview of the violence to come.
          <br><br>
          The second round brought complete devastation for <strong>Ofli</strong>. <strong>Yizha</strong> landed a thunderous left hook that sent the Turkish fighter crashing to the canvas, clearly badly hurt. <strong>Yizha</strong> followed him to the ground and unleashed punishing ground-and-pound that had <strong>Ofli</strong> in serious danger of being finished. When the referee allowed <strong>Ofli</strong> back to his feet, he was out on the feet, stumbling around the octagon as <strong>Yizha</strong> teed off with combinations. <strong>Ofli</strong> shot desperate, panic-driven takedowns that <strong>Yizha</strong> easily shook off while continuing to piece up the compromised fighter. The Chinese striker stalked <strong>Ofli</strong> for the entire round, consistently landing his left hand to <strong>Ofli's</strong> face and threatening to finish the fight with every strike. It was a 10-8 round by any reasonable standard, and many wondered how <strong>Ofli</strong> survived to see the third round.
          <br><br>
          The final frame saw a strategic shift from <strong>Yizha</strong>, who inexplicably backed off and fought more conservatively. His left leg appeared compromised from calf kicks, potentially explaining his reluctance to press forward. <strong>Ofli</strong>, somehow recovered from his near-death experience, returned to his grappling game plan. He clinched against the cage attempting to control the round through positional dominance. The fighters separated and traded in the center before <strong>Ofli</strong> secured another single-leg attempt, pushing <strong>Yizha</strong> back to the fence. <strong>Yizha</strong> circled away and even shot his own takedown, getting <strong>Ofli</strong> to the ground before the Turkish fighter quickly returned to his feet. <strong>Ofli</strong> landed a big elbow in the clinch, and <strong>Yizha</strong> responded with another takedown that <strong>Ofli</strong> immediately scrambled out of. The round was competitive but lacked the dramatic damage that defined the second frame.
          <br><br>
          When the scorecards were read, <strong>Ofli</strong> had squeaked out a majority decision victory—a result that immediately sparked controversy. The fact that <strong>Yizha</strong> nearly killed <strong>Ofli</strong> in the second round but still lost the fight highlights everything wrong with MMA's current scoring criteria. After suffering such a devastating beating, a fighter should not be able to win by accumulating control time against the cage in the other two rounds. The decision suggests that judges valued <strong>Ofli's</strong> takedown attempts and cage pressing more than <strong>Yizha's</strong> fight-altering damage, a troubling precedent that many in the MMA community found unacceptable.
          <br><br>
          From a skills perspective, <strong>Ofli's</strong> boxing looked poor throughout the fight, consistently getting caught with clean shots from <strong>Yizha</strong>. His grappling, while effective at securing positions, lacked the finishing ability or ground-and-pound to make those positions truly threatening. Against top-15 competition, these deficiencies will be brutally exposed. <strong>Ofli</strong> is undeniably tough—surviving the second round proved that—but toughness alone won't carry him against the division's elite. He needs significant improvements in mixing his martial arts and developing actual offensive output from his wrestling positions.
          <br><br>
          For <strong>Yizha</strong>, the loss is frustrating but shouldn't damage his stock significantly. Many observers believed he won the fight, and his performance demonstrated he's likely the better fighter of the two. However, his tactical error of taking the third round off—hoping the judges would award him one of the other competitive frames—cost him the victory. When you dominate someone as thoroughly as he did in the second round, you cannot afford to give your opponent oxygen by coasting. He must learn to maintain pressure and finish compromised opponents rather than allowing them to survive and steal rounds through positional control. Despite the loss, <strong>Yizha's</strong> striking looked sharp, and with better fight IQ and cardio management, he should find success in the UFC's bantamweight division moving forward.

        <h3>Dom Mar Fan vs. Sang Uk Kim</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          Australian bantamweight <strong>Dom Mar Fan</strong> earned his UFC contract with a unanimous decision victory over South Korean <strong>Sang Uk Kim</strong> in the first of three Road to UFC Season 4 Tournament Championship Finals. While <strong>Mar Fan</strong> secured the win through superior damage output, the performance did little to suggest he possesses the ceiling necessary to compete against established UFC bantamweights.
          <br><br>
          Both fighters entered the finale riding four-fight winning streaks through the tournament. <strong>Mar Fan</strong>, nicknamed "Street Buddha" and sporting an 8-2 record, was the -150 favorite despite some concerning details in his resume. Both of his career losses came at the hands of <strong>Quillan Salkilld</strong>—who also competed on this card—via rear-naked choke on the regional scene, suggesting the quality of opposition he'd faced prior to this opportunity was questionable. <strong>Kim</strong>, known as "Frog Man" with a 13-3 record and the +125 underdog, had faced notably tougher competition. His most recent loss came to current UFC fighter <strong>Rongzhu</strong> in August 2023, indicating he'd been tested by legitimate UFC-caliber opponents during his development.
          <br><br>
          The first round began with <strong>Kim</strong> immediately pursuing his grappling game plan, securing a takedown and pinning <strong>Mar Fan</strong> against the cage. <strong>Kim</strong> established back control with one hook in, but <strong>Mar Fan</strong> showed solid defensive awareness, posturing up and reversing the position. They returned to their feet with both men clinching against the cage, where <strong>Mar Fan</strong> landed a nasty elbow that clearly hurt <strong>Kim</strong>. The round concluded with the fighters locked in the clinch against the fence, neither generating significant output—a frustrating pattern that would define much of the fight.
          <br><br>
          The second round saw a shift in momentum. After a tentative start that featured striking in the center, <strong>Kim</strong> advanced forward and clinched against the cage again. Following a brief separation, <strong>Kim</strong> shot for a single-leg takedown and successfully brought <strong>Mar Fan</strong> to the canvas. However, <strong>Mar Fan</strong> quickly reversed position and advanced to half guard, demonstrating superior transitional grappling. He continued advancing position, eventually taking <strong>Kim's</strong> back and dragging the Korean fighter to the fence while working to establish full back control. <strong>Mar Fan</strong> secured one hook and began landing effective ground-and-pound that clearly wore on <strong>Kim</strong>. When <strong>Kim</strong> desperately tried to return to his feet, <strong>Mar Fan</strong> punished him with a brutal elbow on the break. The damage was evident—<strong>Kim</strong> looked slow on the feet, his strikes exaggerated and his evasive movement compromised. Though <strong>Kim</strong> landed a brief flurry, he stalled out for the remainder of the round, visibly fatigued.
          <br><br>
          The final round continued the pattern established throughout the fight. They began striking in the center before <strong>Kim</strong> advanced to clinch against the cage. <strong>Mar Fan</strong> continued landing vicious elbows in the clinch—clearly his most effective weapon—which <strong>Kim</strong> struggled to defend. Each time <strong>Kim</strong> tried to disengage, <strong>Mar Fan</strong> would time perfectly-placed strikes during the separation. <strong>Kim</strong> secured another takedown and landed some effective shots against the cage before the clinch resumed. A low blow from <strong>Mar Fan</strong>—a kick directly to the groin—put <strong>Kim</strong> on the canvas and temporarily halted the action. When the fight resumed, both men began swinging for the fences, with <strong>Kim</strong> showing renewed aggression. However, his apparent anger led him back to the clinch against the cage, effectively killing his own offensive momentum. They separated again, but inevitably found their way back to the clinch for the fight's conclusion. <strong>Mar Fan</strong> landed significant shots in the final moments to seal the victory.
          <br><br>
          The scorecards read 30-27 across the board for <strong>Mar Fan</strong>, though a 29-28 score would have been more accurate given the competitive nature of at least one round. Ultimately, <strong>Mar Fan's</strong> ability to land the bigger, more damaging shots—particularly his devastating elbows in the clinch and during separations—proved decisive. However, the victory was far from impressive. Whenever <strong>Kim</strong> would begin threatening with striking combinations, he would inexplicably clinch against the fence and completely neutralize his own offense, a baffling tactical choice that gifted <strong>Mar Fan</strong> rounds he might have otherwise lost.
          <br><br>
          Moving forward, <strong>Mar Fan's</strong> UFC prospects appear limited. The vast majority of his offense came from landing opportunistic shots in the clinch and during breaks, but he demonstrated no standout grappling or striking that would trouble established UFC bantamweights. His ceiling appears low, and he will likely struggle significantly against anyone in the UFC's top 30 at 135 pounds. The UFC contract is his reward for winning the tournament, but his tenure in the promotion may be short-lived unless he shows dramatic improvements in his next appearance.

        <h3>Keiichiro Nakamura vs. Sebastian Szalay</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Knee at 3:48 Round 3 of 3, 13:48 Total</p>
        <p>
          In a stunning come-from-behind finish, Japanese fighter <strong>Keiichiro Nakamura</strong> earned his UFC contract by knocking out Australian prospect <strong>Sebastian Szalay</strong> with a devastating knee in the final minute of their Road to UFC Season 4 Tournament Championship Final. The dramatic knockout saved <strong>Nakamura</strong> from what appeared to be certain defeat, though the victory raised more questions than answers about his readiness for UFC competition.
          <br><br>
          The matchup featured two undefeated prospects on impressive winning streaks. <strong>Szalay</strong>, nicknamed "Seb" with a 10-1 record, entered as the slight -140 favorite riding a nine-fight win streak dating back to February 2021. The Australian had looked sharp throughout the tournament and appeared poised to join his countrymen on the UFC roster. <strong>Nakamura</strong>, sporting a 7-1 record and near even odds at +115, brought an equally impressive seven-fight win streak. More notably, he had finished six of his seven victories—including his last six consecutive wins before his most recent decision—demonstrating genuine finishing ability that made him dangerous despite being an underdog.
          <br><br>
          The first round began with <strong>Nakamura</strong> showing aggression, throwing serious leg kicks that caught <strong>Szalay's</strong> attention. However, <strong>Szalay</strong> quickly established his superior striking, waiting for openings before exploding forward with crisp combinations. A spin kick from <strong>Szalay</strong> connected cleanly, though <strong>Nakamura</strong> absorbed it without visible damage. As the round progressed, <strong>Szalay</strong> continued advancing and landing combinations while <strong>Nakamura</strong> backed up and circled the octagon. After his initial flurry of leg kicks, <strong>Nakamura</strong> offered virtually no offensive response, content to retreat and absorb punishment. <strong>Szalay</strong> dominated the frame through consistent forward pressure and clean striking while <strong>Nakamura</strong> appeared hesitant and unwilling to engage.
          <br><br>
          The second round continued where the first left off, with <strong>Szalay</strong> maintaining complete control. He landed a clean left hand that stumbled <strong>Nakamura</strong>, then followed up with another left that dropped the Japanese fighter to the canvas. <strong>Nakamura</strong> quickly returned to his feet but continued backing up, offering no meaningful offense. <strong>Szalay</strong> threw <strong>Nakamura</strong> to the ground with authority, though <strong>Nakamura</strong> scrambled back to standing position. A clash of heads temporarily stopped the action mid-round, but when it resumed, <strong>Szalay</strong> immediately returned to his dominant performance. He was piecing up <strong>Nakamura</strong> at will, landing clean combinations while the Japanese fighter remained in pure survival mode, searching desperately for a miracle knockout rather than implementing any coherent strategy.
          <br><br>
          The third round began with the pattern firmly established: <strong>Szalay</strong> advancing and striking, <strong>Nakamura</strong> retreating and absorbing damage. <strong>Nakamura</strong> remained content standing defensively, backing up and letting <strong>Szalay</strong> piece him up without mounting any sustained offense. However, as the round progressed, <strong>Nakamura</strong> began throwing punches with increased frequency, clearly understanding he needed a knockout to avoid losing a lopsided decision. <strong>Szalay</strong>, perhaps sensing the fight was won or feeling the accumulated damage, began fighting more cautiously off the back foot. His output decreased significantly compared to the first two rounds—a tactical error that would prove fatal.
          <br><br>
          With under two minutes remaining, <strong>Nakamura</strong> began advancing more aggressively. <strong>Szalay</strong> stung him with a right hand, but something appeared to have compromised the Australian—whether from accumulated leg kicks earlier or a specific strike in the third round remained unclear. <strong>Szalay's</strong> entire demeanor changed; he was no longer pressing forward with the confidence that had defined the first two rounds. Then, with just 12 seconds left in the fight, <strong>Nakamura</strong> landed a vicious knee to <strong>Szalay's</strong> head that echoed through the arena. The strike landed flush and knocked out <strong>Szalay</strong> cold at 3:48 of the third round, completing one of the most dramatic comebacks in Road to UFC history.
          <br><br>
          The knockout victory earned <strong>Nakamura</strong> his UFC contract, but the performance exposed serious deficiencies that will need addressing before he faces legitimate UFC competition. His passive, defensive approach of standing idle while searching only for the kill shot is a strategy that will fail spectacularly against competent UFC fighters. He was an absolute goner for nearly 13 minutes, showing no ability to implement offense, defend strikes, or create any coherent game plan beyond hoping to land one perfect shot. Against a fighter with better defensive awareness or superior conditioning, this approach would result in a one-sided beatdown with no miraculous finish to save him.
          <br><br>
          For <strong>Szalay</strong>, the loss is devastating given how completely he dominated the fight for the first 13 minutes. His striking and demeanor in the cage looked excellent through the first two rounds, suggesting he possesses legitimate UFC-level skills. The third-round fadeout—whether due to injury, exhaustion, or overconfidence—cost him dearly, but overall his performance was more impressive than the knockout loss suggests. The outcome of Road to UFC finals remains unclear; historically, both winners and losers have received contracts based on performance quality. <strong>Szalay's</strong> dominant showing through two-plus rounds may still earn him an opportunity, while <strong>Nakamura</strong> will definitely receive his contract as the tournament winner—though he'll need to drastically evolve his fighting approach if he hopes to survive beyond one or two UFC appearances.

        <h3>Lawrence Lui vs. Sulangrangbo</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Split at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          In the opening bout of UFC 325 and the final Road to UFC Season 4 Tournament Championship Final, New Zealand's <strong>Lawrence Lui</strong> earned a controversial split decision victory over Chinese standout <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong>, securing a UFC contract in a fight many observers felt he lost. The decision sparked immediate debate about MMA's scoring criteria and whether grappling control should outweigh superior striking and damage.
          <br><br>
          The flyweight clash featured two young prospects on winning streaks through the tournament. <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong>, just 20 years old with a 10-3 record, entered as the heavy -260 favorite riding a nine-fight win streak dating back to his last loss in February 2023. The Chinese fighter had looked impressive throughout the tournament and appeared destined for UFC glory. <strong>Lui</strong>, known as "Lok Yin" with a 7-1 record, was the significant +210 underdog despite his own four-fight winning streak. His last defeat came in May 2022, and he'd shown solid grappling throughout the tournament, though his striking remained a clear weakness.
          <br><br>
          The first round began with <strong>Lui</strong> immediately implementing his wrestling game plan, securing a takedown with a single leg that brought <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> to the canvas. However, <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> quickly returned to his feet against the fence, and <strong>Lui</strong> began kneeing his thigh while wearing on him in the clinch. <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> showed solid defensive awareness, controlling the wrists and creating separation to return to the center of the octagon. Once there, the Chinese fighter began showcasing his superior striking, throwing uppercuts and piecing up <strong>Lui</strong> with significant shots that clearly hurt the New Zealander. In desperation, <strong>Lui</strong> shot for another takedown, but <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> denied it and allowed him back to the feet. The two began swinging viciously with each other, both connecting with big shots in an exciting exchange. <strong>Lui</strong> continued following <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> around the octagon while the Chinese fighter circled and picked his shots. <strong>Lui's</strong> face became increasingly busted up as <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> landed clean strikes, and <strong>Lui</strong> desperately tried to grapple against the cage to stem the damage. The round ended with <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> piecing up <strong>Lui</strong> on the feet in dominant fashion.
          <br><br>
          After an action-packed first round, both fighters started the second more cautiously, feeling each other out in the center. <strong>Lui</strong> shot for another takedown, but <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> denied it and punished him with aggressive strikes upon returning to the feet. <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> then landed a spectacular flying knee that connected cleanly, though <strong>Lui</strong> absorbed it and continued pressing forward. <strong>Lui</strong> secured another takedown attempt, getting <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> against the cage and landing knees to the thighs. He dragged the Chinese fighter away from the fence, but <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> circled back to the cage. <strong>Lui</strong> attempted to drag him away again, but this created an opportunity for <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> to return to his feet. The round concluded with <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> once again piecing up <strong>Lui</strong> with superior striking on the feet. The second frame appeared competitive, with <strong>Lui's</strong> grappling control potentially offsetting <strong>Sulangrangbo's</strong> superior damage output.
          <br><br>
          The third round saw <strong>Lui</strong> continue his forward pressure, walking down <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> who fought intelligently off the back foot, taking opportunities when they presented themselves. However, <strong>Sulangrangbo's</strong> output decreased noticeably in the final frame—cardio clearly becoming a factor as his pace slowed. <strong>Lui</strong> shot in for another takedown, getting <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> against the cage and resuming his pattern of kneeing the thigh. <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> appeared tired and showed no immediate urgency to return to his feet, while <strong>Lui</strong> continued holding onto his leg and wearing on him. When <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> finally returned to standing, he attempted to lay it on <strong>Lui</strong> in the closing moments, but the effort appeared too late to salvage the round.
          <br><br>
          The split decision for <strong>Lui</strong> shocked many observers, with the result likely hinging on the judges' interpretation of the second round. Many felt <strong>Lui</strong> hadn't inflicted enough damage during his grappling control to win that frame, particularly given the superior striking <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> displayed whenever the fight remained standing. The controversy highlights a recurring problem in MMA: should control time and positional dominance outweigh clean striking and visible damage?
          <br><br>
          From a skills perspective, <strong>Lui's</strong> striking remains poor—he charges forward like a zombie with minimal technique, eating clean shots along the way. Against legitimate UFC flyweights, this approach will get him knocked out quickly. He needs significant work on his boxing and defensive movement if he hopes to survive at the highest level. His grappling showed effectiveness in securing positions, but his inability to inflict damage or threaten submissions from those positions limits their value.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Sulangrangbo</strong> demonstrated nice striking throughout the fight that was genuinely entertaining to watch. His combinations were crisp and his timing sharp when his cardio held up. However, his conditioning issues proved decisive—his inability to maintain the output from the first round in both the second and third frames cost him the victory. If he could sustain the pace and volume he showed early, he would be a problem for many flyweights. The cardio deficiency needs immediate addressing in his next training camp.
          <br><br>
          The outcome of these Road to UFC finals remains unclear regarding contracts. <strong>Lui</strong> will almost certainly receive his UFC contract as the tournament winner, though his limited striking and zombie-like forward pressure suggest a short tenure unless he makes dramatic improvements. <strong>Sulangrangbo's</strong> fate is more uncertain—his entertaining striking and moments of brilliance make him an intriguing prospect, and historically the UFC has sometimes signed both finalists from tournament finals based on performance quality. His showing was impressive enough that another opportunity wouldn't be surprising, particularly if he can demonstrate improved conditioning in future appearances.
