      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
          On Saturday, October 11, 2025, the UFC returned to Rio de Janeiro with a high-profile lightweight main event contested between 'fan-favorite' Charles 'do Bronx' Oliveira and 'The Gamer' Mateusz Gamrot, and it did not disappoint.<br><br>

          Coming in as a short-notice replacement, Gamrot came into the fight on Saturday with nothing to lose and everything to gain. Given this, and Oliveira's recent history, I favored the Polish man going into this fight. Yet, I have got to learn. Every single time that I write Oliveira off, the 'Lightweight Lion' always roars back with a signature win. Coming off a vicious first-round KO loss to Ilia Topuria at UFC 316 back in June, I was convinced that Oliveira was coming back too soon. Would he be susceptible to a weakened chin? Would he be hesitant to go into the fire against his opponent? Alas, all of my concerns were for naught as Oliveira went out and dominated the fight.<br><br>
        
          Oliveira easily outgrappled Gamrot in the first, winning the exchanges and forcing Gamrot to scramble. With Oliveira up 10-9 after one, he decided not to let the fight go to the judges and submitted Gamrot with his staple rear-naked choke at 2:48 in the second round.<br><br>

          With the win, Oliveira remains relevant in the lightweight division and sets up a highly anticipated rematch against Max Holloway for the BMF title.<br><br>

          In the co-main event, Deiveson Figueiredo looked to get back on track against bantamweight prospect Montel Jackson. Although not a very exciting fight, Figueiredo was able to get the nod and puts himself back on track to make another title run in pursuit of a second title.<br><br>

          Other noteworthy performances were Joel Alvarez's unanimous decision win over Vicente Luque in his welterweight debut, Mario Pinto's TKO (4:10 Round 2) win over Jhonata Diniz, and Bia Mesquita's one-sided submission (2:14 Round 2) win against Irina Alekseeva in her UFC debut.<br><br>

          Overall, the card was solid and worthwhile to watch, leading to its rating of 6.9/10. My major gripe with the card is that there wasn't a major storyline involved in any of the fights. Sure, Oliveira is a trademarked UFC superstar, but a fight against Gamrot doesn't sell a superfight. Moreover, there wasn't much on the line. If Oliveira lost, he could have easily ridden off into the sunset and no one would have argued against it. Overall, the card delivered. With the exception of the co-main event, which was very forgettable, the fights were exciting and included a variety of finishes of all sorts.

        <h3>Charles Oliveira vs. Mateusz Gamrot</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Rear Naked Choke at 2:48 Round 2 of 5, 7:48 Total</p>
        <p>
          Coming off the most devastating loss of his career, Charles Oliveira reminded us who he was with a signature win over Mateusz Gamrot in front of a home crowd. Although a great result for the Brazilian, the road to get to this fight was anything but smooth. Originally, when the fight was announced back in August, many critiqued the quick turnaround after suffering a brutal KO to Topuria in June. Even after this, Fiziev pulled out of the fight in mid-September, leaving it up in the air as to whether Oliveira would even be able to compete on the card. As he did against Dan Hooker and Jalin Turner in the past, Gamrot stepped up and volunteered to take on the former lightweight champion on short notice. Love him or hate him, you have to respect Gamrot. Dude embodies the "anyone, anywhere, anytime" mentality.<br><br>

          Ultimately, it was a quick night at the office for Oliveira as he dominated the first and then submit the former ADCC champ at 2:48 in the second. What a great win for Oliveira! First off, he is allergic to a boring fight. And still, he manages to add to his legacy, beating a formidable opponent in Gamrot at his own game.<br><br>

          In the post-fight interview, Charles challenged Max Holloway to a rematch for the BMF title. The duo previously met at UFC Fight Night: Oliveira vs. Holloway on August 23, 2015. Holloway emerged victorious in the first meeting with a very strange TKO win, where Oliveira fell at 1:39 in the first round due to a phantom neck/shoulder injury. Both have agreed to the fight on X since the callout, and the UFC would be silly not to make this fight. The two fighters are some of the biggest superstars in the promotion, whose fights are always fireworks. Can Oliveira right the wrong and make his way back to lightweight title contention for a third time in his career?<br><br>

          Not much should change for the Polish man. He took the fight on two and a half weeks' notice with nothing to lose. He'll maintain his eighth spot ranking within the lightweight division and should still be looking at a fight to make his way up the rankings moving forward. "People forget, man," but Gamrot has beaten current "number one contender" Arman Tsarukyan in the past and can hang with the best in the division. Gamrot didn't take any damage in this fight and didn't have a very rigorous camp leading into this one, so he could make a quick turnaround if he wants. But if I were him, I would wait for some things to play out. The result of the matchup between Arman Tsarukyan and Dan Hooker at UFC Qatar on November 22 has a lot of implications for the lightweight division. If Tsarukyan wins and goes on to challenge for the title against Topuria in early 2026, then there are matchups between Gaethje, Pimblett, or Hooker available. So, if I were Gamrot, I'd go to the gym and stay in shape to be able to step in for any of these fights on short notice, but ultimately wait to see the landscape of the lightweight division in early December.

      <div class="fight" id="deiveson-figueiredo-vs-montel-jackson">
        <h3>Deiveson Figueiredo vs. Montel Jackson</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Split at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          Boring. That sums up this fight. Coming off back-to-back losses against Petr Yan and Cory Sandhagen, things weren't looking too good for former flyweight champion Deiveson Figueiredo. He had been on a solid run to the bantamweight title, with wins over Rob Font, Cody Garbrandt, and Marlon Vera, but was now looking at a win-or-retire matchup against Montel Jackson.<br><br>

          The fighters never got going. Figueiredo won the first and second rounds with some reasonable grappling exchanges, but never did any damage on the feet. From Jackson's perspective, he never got going. After clearly losing the first round, Jackson never had any urgency and was gun-shy for the majority of the fight. When he picked his shots, he landed well and consistently on Figueiredo, but there wasn't enough activity to give him the first two rounds.<br><br>

          Going forward, I think Figueiredo needs one more win to solidify himself as a real title contender. Merab's dominance definitely helps his case, as there are no contenders at the top of bantamweight who haven't lost to the champ already. Still, I don't think that one win is enough to garner a title shot. You see champs like Aljo and Merab that have to go on 5 and 10 fight win streaks to get a crack at gold, but you'll give 'Figgy' a shot after one win? Deiveson needs one more.<br><br>

          As for Jackson, you were given a shot at the number 6 contender in the rankings and this is your performance? It didn't look like he was trying to win the fight at all. He was just there to take part. At number 15 in the rankings, I think that he needs to defend his spot against an unranked opponent before he starts to climb the rankings again.

      <div class="fight" id="joel-alvarez-vs-vicente-luque">
        <h3>Joel Alvarez vs. Vicente Luque</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          Joel Alvarez...what a savage! I don't remember if I have ever seen Joel fight before, but going forward I am a fan! He's a big, lengthy Spaniard with power in both his punches and kicks, and killer ground and pound.<br><br>

          In this fight, it was clear that Luque has passed his prime and didn't belong. He couldn't hang with Alvarez. Starting in the first, it was one-way traffic from Alvarez, picking Luque apart on the feet with vicious combinations and kicks up the middle. In the second, Alvarez got on top of Luque on the ground and obliterated the Brazilian with ground and pound. In my opinion, the fight could have been stopped at any point. However, Luque's "intelligent defense" kept him in it. A clear 10-8 for Alvarez. Going into the third, Luque needed a finish, but he couldn't deliver. Alvarez, exhausted from the punishment he dealt in the second, didn't have enough in the tank to finish the fight but held on to win the round and a unanimous 30-26 decision from the judges.<br><br>

          It was an impressive welterweight debut from the Spaniard against a legend in Vicente Luque, and there should be good matchups for him in the division. Maybe a Kevin Holland or a Daniel Rodriguez matchup next?<br><br>

          I don't know what is next for Luque. I don't think that a 2-fight losing streak is as damning as it used to be, but I don't see him fighting for a title ever again in his career. At 33 years old, he needs to heal up and figure out what he wants to get out of the sport moving forward.<br><br>
        
          In the first round of this fight, there was controversy when the outside of Alvarez's fist hit Luque's eye and Luque fell to the ground in pain, exclaiming that it was an eye poke. The ref immediately stopped the fight, and in the replay, it was clear that Alvarez had hit Luque with a legal blow. Instead of immediately resuming the fight, the ref brought a doctor in to check the condition of Luque's eye and gave him a four-minute break. People complained that since the stoppage was unwarranted and Luque had stopped fighting intentionally, the fight should have either been immediately resumed or resulted in a TKO victory for Alvarez. In the end, it didn't matter, as Luque's fate had been sealed when the cage door was first closed.

      <div class="fight" id="mario-pinto-vs-jhonata-diniz">
        <h3>Mario Pinto vs. Jhonata Diniz</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Punches From Full Mount at 4:10 Round 2 of 3, 9:10 Total</p>
        <p>
          Heavyweight has a new contender in Mario Pinto! Having won his fight on 'The Contender Series' by ground and pound, and his UFC debut by knockout, Pinto looked to get his first real test against a formidable kickboxer in Jhonata Diniz.<br><br>

          To our surprise, Pinto started and finished the fight showing his grappling prowess. Pinto dominated the first, taking Diniz down and constantly threatening submissions to earn himself a clear 10-8 round. Pinto kept the momentum going into the second and finished Diniz with some vicious ground and pound from the crucifix position.<br><br>

          Although giving a dominant performance, the most memorable part of the fight was his post-fight interview. In it, Pinto begins speaking in Portuguese, saying, "My English is not so good..." with a thick Portuguese accent to win over the Brazilian crowd. However, ten seconds later, Pinto broke character to thank his team "for pulling multiple graveyard shifts" with him during his fight camp in a very clear British accent. It was a funny moment, and something to remember going forward.<br><br>

          Pinto could be a problem at heavyweight—he's got hands and grappling. If he doesn't get a ranked opponent next, he should only fight one more unranked fighter before making a run for the belt. This division needs contenders.

        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Standing Rear Naked Choke at 3:02 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>
          After being threatened early by Ramos's kneebar in the first, Ofli turned the tides and scored a nice rear-naked choke off of Ramos's back on the feet.<br><br>

          With the win, Ofli saves his UFC career after going down 0-2 in his first two bouts. Going forward, Ofli needs to start stacking up some wins to get into talks about fighting ranked fighters, and now going on a two-fight losing streak, Ramos needs to get back on track.

        <p>
          Michael Aswell dominated Lucas Almeida in this fight. Almeida didn't belong in there and was knocked down multiple times in the first. The fight could have been stopped at multiple points.<br><br>

          Again, Aswell needs to start racking up some wins, while Almeida is in dire need of a win to keep his job within the UFC.

        <p>
          Jafel Filho is nice! There were a lot of creative finishes on this card, and Filho's should not be forgotten. The Brazilian dominated the fight and got the signature win in the first round.<br><br>

          Going forward, Filho needs to keep working on getting back to ranked opponents, while Carpenter looks to get back on track, having gone on a two-fight losing streak.

        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Right Uppercut and Left Hook at 0:26 Round 3 of 3, 10:26 Total</p>
        <p>
          Vitor Petrino came to fight and dominated the first round on the feet. Petersen was able to hang in there and weather the storm. In the second, things started to look poor for Petrino as he started to get tired. However, he kept his composure and got a nasty flat-line KO in the third.<br><br>

          Realistically, I don't see Petrino going very far in the UFC. He was submitted by an aging Anthony Smith and lost to Dustin Jacoby. Still, with a two-fight win streak at light heavyweight, he could become a force in the UFC's worst division. We'll have to see what happens. I don't see much success for Thomas Petersen in the future. I don't think much of Petrino, and Petersen still couldn't hang.
        </p>

      <div class="fight" id="bia-mesquita-vs-irina-alekseeva">
        <h3>Bia Mesquita vs. Irina Alekseeva</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Rear Naked Choke at 2:14 Round 2 of 3, 7:14 Total</p>
        <p>
          Bia Mesquita is for real! A former ADCC champion, coming into her UFC debut 5-0, Mesquita made a statement in her UFC debut. Mesquita was quick to get Alekseeva to the ground, and once she got Irina there, Mesquita didn't give her an inch. The first round ended up being an absolute onslaught of ground and pound that resulted in a 10-8 round for the newcomer. The second round saw more of the same, until Bia got the rear-naked choke in and won her first fight in the UFC.<br><br>

          Mesquita could be a real problem in the women's bantamweight division—a division that needs some life right now. Realistically, I can see Mesquita beating a large majority of the ranked women in the division. We'll just have to see who the UFC gives her next. Maybe Daria Zhelezniakova? As for Alekseeva, I am not sure what is next for her. Currently on a 3-fight losing streak, she could possibly lose her spot in the promotion. However, with a lack of talent in women's MMA, she could be kept by the UFC.

        <h3>Lucas Rocha vs. Stewart Nicoll</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          Lucas Rocha dominated this fight on the feet. Nicoll really never got going. He attempted a couple of takedowns in the first round but completely gassed after that. After the first round, Nicoll kept trying some weak takedown attempts that never amounted to anything, and that was the beginning of the end.<br><br>

          Both of these fighters are early in their UFC careers, so we'll have to see what happens with them next. The major takeaway from the fight is that Nicoll desperately needs to work on his cardio.

        <p>
          At 39 years old, it might be time for Karolina Kowalkiewicz to call it a career. On a three-fight losing streak and not much to show for this fight, I can't imagine things getting better for her if she sticks around in the sport any longer.<br><br>

          The fight was one-way traffic with Polastri dominating on the feet, until she eventually scored a nasty head kick in the third, which resulted in a KO win.

        <p>
          Another fight that was shrouded in controversy after Saimon Oliveira showed up 8 pounds overweight on Friday. Luckily for Lacerda, it didn't matter, as Oliveira just isn't a UFC-caliber fighter. Oliveira really couldn't get going until the end when he started landing some nice elbows. However, the success was short-lived as Lacerda scored a nice armbar submission, keeping the fight from going to the judges.<br><br>

          With the deck stacked against him, Lacerda got the job done and 50% of his opponent's purse. Unfortunately for Oliveira, I imagine that this is the end of his UFC career. Currently on a three-fight losing streak and coming in 8 pounds overweight, I can't imagine that they give him another opportunity.
