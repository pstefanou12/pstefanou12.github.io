      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>UFC Fight Night: Bonfim vs. Brown delivered a mixed bag of results, ultimately cementing its reputation as a decent Apex card with flashes of brilliance. The main event saw <strong>Gabriel Bonfim make a huge statement</strong>, dismantling Randy Brown with brutal calf kicks before securing a TKO victory and calling out a top name.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The rest of the main card was defined by highlight-reel finishes from rising talents: <strong>Uros Medic, Chris Padilla, and Christian Leroy Duncan all secured impressive knockouts</strong> or TKOs, signaling their readiness for ranked competition. The most frustrating performance of the night was from Ismael Bonfim, who missed weight by a large margin and then lost by TKO, losing a massive portion of his paycheck.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Unfortunately, the event suffered from a truly baffling co-main event (Schnell vs. Morales), where Schnell inexplicably shot a takedown and was submitted immediately, and some extremely low-output preliminary fights (Pennington vs. Gomes), leading to the overall modest <strong>5.3/10 rating</strong>. However, the high finishing rate across the rest of the card, particularly in the heavyweight debut of Josh Hokit and Zach Reese's submission win, provided enough action to make it a worthwhile watch.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Gabriel Bonfim vs. Randy Brown</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Clinch Knee at 1:40 Round 2 of 5, 6:40 Total</p>
        <p><strong>Gabriel Bonfim</strong> (18-1) entered the cage on a three-fight win streak after a controversial split decision over "Wonderboy," while <strong>Randy Brown</strong> was looking to extend his own momentum against the division's top talent. A win here meant a ranked opponent and a legitimate push toward title contention. The fight kicked off with Brown throwing jabs, but the story was written on his lead left leg almost immediately.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Bonfim started <strong>eating up that leg with brutal low kicks</strong>, quickly dismantling Brown's game plan to the point where Brown was losing his balance and switching stances, acting spuriously. Once the leg was hurt, Bonfim's jab started landing easily. Brown managed to rally in the second, hitting some nice combinations, but Bonfim relentlessly went back to the calf kick, which continued to cause problems.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Then, Bonfim landed a <strong>perfect knee</strong>, and Mark Smith stepped in. While Brown and others complained about the early stoppage, Brown was completely outclassed and visibly out cold for a split second before hitting the canvas, making it a good, necessary stoppage—Bonfim was ready to absolutely obliterate him if the fight had continued. This was an impressive statement by Bonfim, who earned the right to call out Colby Covington post-fight.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="joseph-morales-vs-matt-schnell">
        <h3>Joseph Morales vs. Matt Schnell</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Guillotine Choke at 2:54 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>It's honestly crazy that <strong>Schnell vs. Morales</strong> was a co-main event in 2025, considering Schnell was 1-3 in his last four and neither man had any star power. Schnell started aggressively with crisp jabs, but he made the baffling decision to shoot a takedown, and that was the beginning and end of his night.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Morales immediately reversed the position, secured half guard, and started landing short elbows. He quickly transitioned to a crucifix, then locked up a fight-ending <strong>guillotine submission</strong> in the first round. I have no idea what Schnell was doing in there; it literally felt like he was just there for a paycheck, completely outclassed on the feet and especially on the ground. That's four losses in a row for Schnell—what was he doing in a co-main event slot? This fight in this spot just shows the UFC didn't care about this event. Morales got his first win in his second UFC stint, and he needs to start stacking up many more before we can talk about the rankings.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="uros-medic-vs-muslim-salikhov">
        <h3>Uros Medic vs. Muslim Salikhov</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Straight Left to Ground Punches at 1:03 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>The "King of Sanda," 41-year-old <strong>Muslim Salikhov</strong>, was making what felt like his last title run, entering on a three-fight win streak against <strong>Uros Medic</strong>, who was looking to move up in competition. Medic wasted no time, finding early success with leg kicks before landing a <strong>nasty, straight jab</strong> that put Salikhov down immediately.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Medic followed up with brutal, unforgiving head shots on the ground, securing a quick first-round knockout victory. This was a huge statement win for Medic, who is now on a two-fight win streak and maintains a <strong>100% finish rate</strong>. He deserves one more test before he should face a top 15 contender. For Salikhov, this is likely the unfortunate end of the road for his long career.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="chris-padilla-vs-ismael-bonfim">
        <h3>Chris Padilla vs. Ismael Bonfim</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Ground and Pound at 4:30 Round 2 of 3, 9:30 Total</p>
        <p>This fight started with an unfortunate footnote: <strong>Ismael Bonfim</strong> missed weight by five pounds, losing 25% of his purse before the bell even rang. He was fighting a rising <strong>Chris Padilla</strong> (2-0 UFC) who was looking to establish himself. The first round was a measured affair, transitioning from boxing and low kicks to a long, dull clinch against the cage until Bonfim broke free with 20 seconds left to throw some bombs.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the second, both men started throwing heat. Bonfim unleashed brutal, extended combinations, seriously attacking Padilla's body. Padilla wisely countered with a body shot and a knee up the middle that <strong>broke Bonfim</strong>. Bonfim shot a desperate takedown, and Padilla capitalized, landing a <strong>legal knee to the head</strong> as Bonfim was hunched over.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Bonfim collapsed, pulling guard, and Padilla finished with ground and pound. That's a tough hand for Bonfim, losing his win bonus on top of his purse penalty. The body shot was the end. I don't know what the ref was waiting for; Bonfim was motionless, and Padilla was landing brutal headshots—was he waiting for Bonfim to stop having a pulse? It was a great win for Padilla, extending his UFC win streak to three. He's earned a ranked opponent next. His post-fight speech, imploring the UFC for a bonus because his mother lives in a trailer, was a sad, necessary reminder of the financial struggles most fighters live with.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="christian-leroy-duncan-vs-marco-tulio">
        <h3>Christian Leroy Duncan vs. Marco Tulio</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Spinning Backfist and Punches at 3:28 Round 2 of 3, 8:28 Total</p>
        <p><strong>Marco Tulio</strong> (3-0 UFC) was taking a serious step up in competition against the more seasoned veteran <strong>Christian Leroy Duncan</strong>. Duncan didn't waste time, hitting Tulio with a <strong>nasty spinning elbow</strong> early that cut him, prompting an immediate, desperate clinch against the cage from Tulio. Tulio secured a brief takedown but couldn't keep Duncan down. Tulio's desperation showed as he kept holding Duncan against the cage, which Duncan reversed and then slammed Tulio to the ground later in the round.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The second round saw Tulio try to open up his hands, but Duncan responded with a combination that visibly startled him, sending him straight back to clinching. Then, Duncan landed a <strong>nasty spinning backfist that stunned Tulio</strong>, followed up with big shots to put him out for good. Middleweight has a new prospect in Christian Leroy Duncan. Now on a three-fight win streak, he is absolutely ready for a ranked opponent. It was clear from Tulio's desperate, constant attempts to grapple that he simply couldn't hang on on the feet. Crazy knockout. Great fight.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="jamall-emmers-vs-hyder-amil">
        <h3>Jamall Emmers vs. Hyder Amil</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p><strong>Jamall Emmers</strong> came into this looking to finally break his win-one, lose-one pattern, while <strong>Hyder Amil</strong> was seeking redemption after his first career loss by knockout. Amil was constantly walking forward and throwing, despite getting hit, but Emmers was landing cleaner with jabs and 1-2s. Once Amil's big countering hooks started bothering Emmers, the veteran smartly utilized his wrestling, taking Amil to the ground.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Emmers spent the majority of the second round smothering Amil, landing ground and pound and controlling the pace. The third round was all Emmers on the ground. He took the fight down immediately and <strong>smothered Amil for the majority of the round</strong>. Amil was visibly exhausted, breathing hard, and had no answer to Emmers's grappling prowess, constantly getting dragged back down whenever he tried to stand. Emmers showed he was the veteran against Amil, who unfortunately lost a lot of his prospect hype in this performance.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="raoni-barcelos-vs-ricky-simón">
        <h3>Raoni Barcelos vs. Ricky Simón</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>This bantamweight matchup had significant implications for getting a top-10 fight next. <strong>Ricky Simón</strong> was looking to extend his two-fight win streak against 38-year-old veteran <strong>Raoni Barcelos</strong>, who was on a three-fight win streak, having recently *fraud-checked* Payton Talbott. Barcelos landed a <strong>nasty uppercut</strong> early in the first, but Simón held his composure and pressed forward. While Barcelos secured a takedown, Simón reversed the position, landing hammer fists from on top before Barcelos got separation and worked his way back to his feet. Both men were throwing power shots throughout the first.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The second round was much closer, with both men showing <strong>really good head movement</strong> to evade strikes. Simón easily shucked off a single-leg attempt, but Barcelos kept working his powerful jabs and uppercuts. The third round was a continuation of power, with both men throwing everything they had until the final bell, punctuated by a <strong>nasty left knee</strong> from Barcelos as the clock wound down. This was a solid fight that showcased high-level boxing from both men. Barcelos is now on a four-fight win streak and has absolutely earned a fight up the rankings, perhaps against Marcus McGhee or Kyler Phillips next.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="jacqueline-cavalcanti-vs-mayra-bueno-silva">
        <h3>Jacqueline Cavalcanti vs. Mayra Bueno Silva</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>It has been a serious fall from grace for <strong>Mayra Bueno Silva</strong>, who was facing elimination after three consecutive losses, making any future title shot far-fetched. <strong>Jacqueline Cavalcanti</strong>, riding a four-fight win streak, was looking to crack the bantamweight rankings. The first round was low output; Silva did very little but found moderate success with kicks, while Cavalcanti used her jab and leg kicks well. Cavalcanti landed a big 1-2, which prompted Silva to shoot a takedown attempt that Cavalcanti easily shrugged off.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Cavalcanti picked up the pace in the second, piecing up Silva with combinations, though a period of clinching hindered her advances. In the third, Cavalcanti came out ready to make a statement, landing big shots early. Silva shot a desperate, failed takedown and started to wear the damage on her face. Silva threw caution to the wind and started boxing, landing a nasty jab, but <strong>whenever Silva took a step forward, Cavalcanti always had a response</strong>. Ultimately, Silva got going too late and was wearing the damage badly by the end. This wasn't a jaw-dropping performance, but it was a reasonable win for the budding bantamweight contender. Cavalcanti will continue to steadily rise up the rankings.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="josh-hokit-vs-max-gimenis">
        <h3>Josh Hokit vs. Max Gimenis</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Right Hook at 0:56 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>Former football player <strong>Josh Hokit</strong> (6-0) made his debut on a quick turnaround against <strong>Max Gimenis</strong> (6-1), who was known for his extensive, high-level jiu-jitsu and ADCC background. This fight lasted only moments. Hokit landed a <strong>massive right hand</strong> in the first round that immediately knocked Gimenis down.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Gimenis got back to his feet, but Hokit followed up relentlessly, landing nasty right hooks on the fence until Mark Smith stepped in to stop the fight. This was a huge debut for Hokit, demonstrating that raw athletic ability can take you far in heavyweight MMA. At 7-0, he's someone to watch, but let's not rush him—heavyweight needs contenders. Hokit called out Valter Walker, but let's take it slow. As for Gimenis, he was likely caught under the illusion that his extensive grappling credentials were enough, but this is MMA, and you need a well-rounded skillset to compete.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="fight" id="denise-gomes-vs-tecia-pennington">
        <h3>Denise Gomes vs. Tecia Pennington</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p><strong>Tecia Pennington</strong>, at 36, was looking to make a final title run against the young, budding contender <strong>Denise Gomes</strong>, who was on a three-fight win streak. It's surreal that Pennington, once on a four-fight losing streak, is ranked thirteenth. The entire fight was an <strong>extremely low-output, difficult-to-judge affair</strong>. Pennington used kicks to maintain range, while Gomes was slightly more aggressive in pressing forward.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The low output continued into the third, until Pennington executed a nice judo throw for a takedown. Gomes immediately reversed the position and secured control time, landing some nice <strong>ground and pound</strong> toward the end. Then, with about 10 seconds left, Gomes stood up, essentially giving Pennington a chance to get back in the fight. <strong>This was a really terrible fight.</strong> Nothing happened until the final minute, and then Gomes stood up—which is not only stupid but <strong>lame</strong>. Why are you letting her back into the fight? If this is the level of performance it takes to stay in the promotion, both of these women should be cut; we saw how Talita Alencar had to fight for her contract last week by aggressively finishing her opponent.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="daniel-marcos-vs-miles-johns">
        <h3>Daniel Marcos vs. Miles Johns</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Rear Naked Choke at 4:23 Round 2 of 3, 9:23 Total</p>
        <p><strong>Miles Johns</strong> was facing a two-fight losing streak and likely fighting for his job against <strong>Daniel Marcos</strong>, who was looking to bounce back from his first career loss. The obvious bad blood was palpable. Marcos started by giving up calf kicks, but quickly caught one and secured a takedown. Johns got back up and reversed, holding Marcos against the cage. After getting tagged with a right, Johns looked startled and immediately shot for another takedown. Marcos reversed that position, landed a nasty knee, and ended the first round dragging Johns against the fence.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Johns started the second round throwing much <strong>longer combinations</strong> and finding more success on the feet. Marcos wasn't having any of it, taking Johns down again. The bulk of the round was dull control time by Marcos, who inflicted little damage until he finally got the back, sunk in a <strong>rear naked choke, and put Johns to sleep</strong>. It was a pretty dull, low-output fight overall. Johns only found success on the feet when throwing long combinations, but Marcos preferred the ground. I still don't understand why Johns didn't tap—why go to sleep and risk real brain damage? After that performance, I'm not that excited to watch Marcos fight again, but he should be given a ranked opponent, perhaps Chito, if he isn't cut.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="fight" id="zach-reese-vs-jackson-mcvey">
        <h3>Zach Reese vs. Jackson McVey</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Rear Naked Choke at 1:38 Round 2 of 3, 6:38 Total</p>
        <p>This fight was a mess of short-notice replacements, with <strong>Zach Reese</strong> stepping in on super short notice against <strong>Jackson McVey</strong>. The fight began quickly as Reese came out swinging and connected with an early right hook. McVey immediately took the fight into the clinch against the cage, where he landed nasty elbows and knees, even knocking Reese down with a knee to the body. After pushing Reese back to the fence, McVey hit him with a low blow, and during a clinch exchange, Reese suffered a <strong>gnarly cut</strong> over his eyebrow, forcing a doctor's check.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Upon resumption, McVey went right back to the clinch, but Reese reversed, scored a takedown, easily passed the guard, and got to mount. In the second round, McVey tried to clinch again, but Reese used his forward momentum against him, taking the fight to the ground. As McVey tried to get back to his feet, Reese expertly took his back and sunk in a fight-ending <strong>rear naked choke</strong> for the Round 2 submission win.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It was a good back-and-forth fight; McVey put on the pressure in Round 1, but once Reese realized McVey had <strong>no response to any form of grappling</strong>, the writing was on the wall. McVey looked good standing but was completely lost on the ground. It was a solid win for Reese on short notice. I'm constantly reminded that a Contender Series win means absolutely nothing against UFC-caliber competition. While it's a great filter short-term, I'm not convinced it's good long-term, as it prematurely pushes regional talent into three-fight losing streaks that end careers due to the lack of other reputable promotions.</p>
