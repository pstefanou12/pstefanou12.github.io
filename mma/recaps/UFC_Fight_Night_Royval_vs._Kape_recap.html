      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>UFC Fight Night: Royval vs. Kape delivered another Apex card that struggled to generate excitement. The event took place on Saturday, December 13, 2025, and featured a flyweight headliner between <strong>Brandon Royval</strong> and <strong>Manel Kape</strong> that ended in dramatic fashion. The card showcased a mix of rising prospects and veterans fighting for their UFC futures, with several finishes providing the highlights in an otherwise lackluster event.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The main event saw <strong>Manel Kape</strong> deliver a devastating first-round knockout over <strong>Brandon Royval</strong>, potentially inserting himself into the flyweight title picture. Earlier on the main card, <strong>Kevin Vallejos</strong> pulled off a stunning comeback against <strong>Giga Chikadze</strong> with a spinning backfist finish, while <strong>Cezary Oleksiejczuk</strong> controlled <strong>César Almeida</strong> with relentless grappling. The preliminary card featured <strong>Yaroslav Amosov</strong> making a statement with a quick submission of <strong>Neil Magny</strong>, and <strong>Jamey-Lyn Horth</strong> securing a first-round TKO over <strong>Tereza Bledá</strong>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Despite some solid finishes scattered throughout the night, the overall card struggled to maintain momentum. The Apex venue, with its lack of crowd energy, continued to dampen the atmosphere of these Fight Night events. Several matchups felt like mismatches, and the pacing between fights left much to be desired. While prospects like <strong>Guilherme Pat</strong> and <strong>Steven Asplund</strong> secured wins, questions remain about the depth of competition they faced. The event serves as a reminder that not every Fight Night card can deliver memorable moments, and this one will likely be remembered primarily for Kape's explosive finish in the main event.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

      <div class="fight" id="manel-kape-vs-brandon-royval">
        <h3>Manel Kape vs. Brandon Royval</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Right Hook to Ground Punches at 3:18 Round 1 of 5</p>
        <p>This was a clash between two flyweight contenders looking to position themselves for a title shot in a division that may have received new life following the recent championship change. <strong>Brandon Royval</strong> entered the octagon coming off a loss to Joshua Van, while <strong>Manel Kape</strong> was riding a two-fight win streak with victories over Bruno Silva and Asu Almabayev. Both fighters had tasted defeat against former champion Alexandre Pantoja, with Royval suffering two losses to the Brazilian. Adding intrigue to this matchup was the fact that these two were scheduled to fight twice earlier in the year, with both bouts ultimately being canceled—making this third attempt the charm.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The opening round began with both fighters circling the octagon, feeling each other out in a measured exchange. Low kicks, jabs, and small hooks were thrown as both men moved carefully around the cage. <strong>Royval</strong> found some success landing body kicks, and while <strong>Kape</strong> repeatedly caught them, he failed to capitalize with counters. The chess match continued until Kape changed everything in an instant—connecting with a devastating right hand that sent Royval crashing to the canvas. <strong>Kape</strong> immediately followed up with multiple shots on the ground, forcing the referee to step in and wave off the fight at 3:18 of the first round.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The finish was as nasty as it was decisive. While some observers questioned whether the stoppage came too early, the optics told a different story—<strong>Royval</strong> appeared to be unconscious from the initial right hand. <strong>Kape</strong> delivered a statement performance that cannot be ignored by the UFC matchmakers. Given that Tatsuro Taira appears to be next in line for a title shot after his finish of Brandon Moreno, the path forward for Kape depends largely on when Alexandre Pantoja returns. If Pantoja comes back immediately, a number one contender bout between Kape and Taira makes sense. However, if there's a longer wait, Kape could be positioned to face the loser of a potential Taira vs. Van championship bout. As for <strong>Royval</strong>, a matchup with someone like Steve Erceg would allow him to rebuild and work his way back into contention.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="kevin-vallejos-vs-giga-chikadze">
        <h3>Kevin Vallejos vs. Giga Chikadze</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Spinning Backfist and Elbows at 1:29 Round 2 of 3, 6:29 Total</p>
        <p>This was a pivotal matchup between a rising star and a veteran fighting for his UFC future. <strong>Kevin Vallejos</strong> entered as a hot Argentinian prospect with serious hype behind him, boasting a 16-1 record and riding a two-fight win streak in the UFC. Vallejos first caught UFC fans' attention after a close decision loss to Jean Silva on the Contender Series back in 2023, and since then had been perfect while Silva went on to challenge Diego Lopes in a number one contender bout. There was widespread belief that Vallejos could become the next big star in the UFC, making this matchup against <strong>Giga Chikadze</strong> a legitimate test. For Chikadze, a former kickboxer who had been with the UFC since 2019, the stakes couldn't be higher. After dropping his last two bouts to Arnold Allen and David Onama, the 37-year-old was essentially fighting for his spot in the promotion—a loss here could result in his release, and a three-fight losing streak would crush any remaining hopes of ever challenging for the belt.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The first round began with <strong>Chikadze</strong> slipping while throwing a leg kick, allowing <strong>Vallejos</strong> to charge forward and land two right hands. When Giga threw a left kick that Vallejos caught, the Argentinian was unable to secure a takedown. <strong>Chikadze</strong> then unleashed a flurry of strikes that forced Vallejos to clinch against the cage in desperation. The exchanges left Giga's left leg bleeding aggressively, but he continued to press forward. After separation, they returned to the center of the octagon where <strong>Chikadze</strong> threw numerous leg kicks, though Vallejos struggled to generate any real offense. The round clearly belonged to Chikadze, who appeared to be in control.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The second round began with <strong>Vallejos</strong> looking extremely timid, seemingly still affected by the first-round beating. Then, in a flash, everything changed. <strong>Vallejos</strong> launched a spinning backfist that connected perfectly, completely shutting off <strong>Chikadze's</strong> lights. He immediately followed up with nasty ground and pound before referee Mark Smith stepped in to end the fight at 1:29 of the second round.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The finish was both spectacular and unfortunate. <strong>Vallejos</strong> is clearly too small for the division, forcing him to cover significant distance to land strikes—a terrible base for MMA. After the first round, it appeared he was dead to rights, only to come back with that devastating spinning backfist. For a smaller fighter, getting opponents against the cage becomes crucial since it eliminates their ability to move and counter, though taller fighters don't face this same necessity. For <strong>Chikadze</strong>, it was a heartbreaking loss. He was clearly winning the fight, and Vallejos couldn't get anything going until he simply got caught. Despite this setback, Chikadze should not be cut or forced to retire—he's still skilled enough to compete, though a change of camps might be worth considering. As for <strong>Vallejos</strong>, it's time to up the ante. A matchup with someone like Josh Emmett or "Pitbull" would be the next logical step to continue building this intriguing prospect.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="cezary-oleksiejczuk-vs-césar-almeida">
        <h3>Cezary Oleksiejczuk vs. César Almeida</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>This middleweight matchup pitted a dangerous striker against a grappling-heavy newcomer. <strong>César Almeida</strong> entered with momentum, coming off a sensational first-round knockout of Abdul Razak Alhassan back in January, though he hadn't fought since. With a record of 7-1 overall and 4-1 in the UFC, Almeida was riding a two-fight win streak and looking to continue his ascent up the rankings. A former top-tier kickboxer who boasts two wins over Alex Pereira, Almeida represented one of the most dangerous strikers in the division, and a victory here would position him for another step toward title contention. <strong>Cezary Oleksiejczuk</strong>, meanwhile, was making his UFC debut after winning on the Contender Series in September. With a 16-3 record and a preference for making first-round statement victories, Oleksiejczuk was looking to announce his arrival in emphatic fashion.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The first round immediately revealed <strong>Oleksiejczuk's</strong> game plan. About a minute into the fight, he took <strong>Almeida</strong> down and nearly secured a crucifix position, beginning to deliver shoulder strikes to Almeida's face. <strong>Almeida</strong> attempted to pull Oleksiejczuk toward him, but Cezary continued landing shoulders relentlessly. As Almeida moved closer to the fence trying to create separation, he still couldn't get back to his feet. With roughly 30 seconds remaining in the round, <strong>Almeida</strong> finally made it back up, but there simply wasn't enough time to salvage the round.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The second round saw <strong>Almeida</strong> come out knowing he needed to keep <strong>Oleksiejczuk</strong> at bay, so he began throwing significantly more kicks to both the legs and body. When César landed a big right that stung Oleksiejczuk, Cezary used the strike as an opportunity to secure another takedown. <strong>Almeida</strong> managed to get back to his feet, but <strong>Oleksiejczuk</strong> kept his back pinned against the cage before taking him down again in the middle of the octagon. In a brief moment of hope, <strong>Almeida</strong> secured a reversal and moved into mount, beginning to work. However, when Almeida pushed off to get back to his feet, he stumbled—poor reflexes cost him dearly as <strong>Oleksiejczuk</strong> immediately took him back down. Cezary then secured Almeida in a crucifix and started landing elbows.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The third round continued the pattern of dominance. <strong>Oleksiejczuk</strong> secured a double leg, lifted <strong>Almeida</strong> up, and slammed him onto the canvas. An elbow to the cup stopped the action momentarily—though Almeida had also kneed Oleksiejczuk in the head during the same exchange. With no point deduction, they returned to their feet, but <strong>Oleksiejczuk</strong> immediately went for another takedown and got it. He moved into mount and landed nasty elbows from on top, briefly threatening an arm triangle before abandoning it. When <strong>Almeida</strong> tried to get back to his feet, Cezary continued to wear on him until the final bell.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The story that plagued <strong>César Almeida</strong> when he started in the UFC remains his story today—he cannot grapple, and worse, he seems complacent with staying on his back. <strong>Oleksiejczuk</strong> simply grappled the hell out of him and laid on top of him for three rounds. Almeida needs to dramatically improve his grappling immediately or consider retirement. He cannot compete with anyone in the top 15 because no one will willingly stand with a fighter who possesses nuclear power on the feet. Unless he addresses this glaring weakness, he will never be a champion. As for <strong>Oleksiejczuk</strong>, it's unclear how much weight should be given to this victory. He grappled someone who can't grapple—the real question is how he'll perform against wrestlers and grapplers elsewhere in the division. That remains to be seen.</p>

        <h3>Melquizael Costa vs. Morgan Charrière</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Head Kick at 1:14 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>This featherweight battle showcased <strong>Morgan Charrière's</strong> dangerous striking against <strong>Melquizael Costa</strong> in what proved to be a brief but explosive encounter. <strong>Charrière</strong> wasted no time imposing his will, and just over a minute into the opening round, he delivered a devastating head kick that sent <strong>Costa</strong> crashing to the canvas. The referee immediately stepped in to wave off the fight at 1:14 of the first round, giving Charrière a spectacular knockout victory.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The finish demonstrated <strong>Charrière's</strong> elite striking ability and reinforced his status as one of the more dangerous fighters in the featherweight division. For <strong>Costa</strong>, it was a harsh reminder of the high level of competition in the UFC. Moving forward, <strong>Charrière</strong> should continue climbing the rankings with performances like this, while <strong>Costa</strong> will need to regroup and work on his defensive awareness to avoid similar outcomes in future bouts.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="kennedy-nzechukwu-vs-marcus-buchecha">
        <h3>Kennedy Nzechukwu vs. Marcus Buchecha</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Ends in a Draw, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>This light heavyweight clash between <strong>Kennedy Nzechukwu</strong> and jiu-jitsu legend <strong>Marcus "Buchecha" Almeida</strong> went the full 15 minutes and ended in a rare unanimous draw. The back-and-forth nature of the fight made it difficult for judges to separate the two competitors, with each man having moments of success throughout the three rounds.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Nzechukwu</strong> utilized his striking and reach advantage to control portions of the fight, while <strong>Buchecha</strong> looked to leverage his world-class grappling pedigree whenever possible. Neither fighter was able to definitively take control of the bout, resulting in a stalemate on the scorecards. The draw leaves both men in a frustrating position—neither gaining ground nor losing momentum in a competitive light heavyweight division.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Moving forward, both <strong>Nzechukwu</strong> and <strong>Buchecha</strong> will need to secure decisive victories in their next outings to continue their progression toward the top 15. The draw serves as a learning experience for both fighters as they work to sharpen their skills and capitalize on opportunities in future matchups.</p>

        <h3>King Green vs. Lance Gibson Jr.</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Split at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>This welterweight bout between <strong>King Green</strong> and <strong>Lance Gibson Jr.</strong> went the distance, with the judges rendering a split decision that highlighted how competitive the matchup was. The fight featured contrasting styles and back-and-forth action that made it difficult to score definitively.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Throughout the three rounds, both <strong>Green</strong> and <strong>Gibson</strong> had their moments, with neither man able to pull away decisively. The close nature of the exchanges and rounds led to disagreement among the judges, ultimately resulting in a split decision victory. The competitive showing from both fighters suggests they belong in the UFC, though the victor will need to build on this performance while the loser must regroup and make adjustments.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Moving forward, the winner will look to parlay this victory into a matchup against a higher-ranked opponent, while the losing fighter will need to demonstrate improvement in their next outing to stay relevant in a crowded welterweight division.</p>

        <h3>Yaroslav Amosov vs. Neil Magny</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Anaconda Choke at 3:14 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>This welterweight prelim headliner featured former Bellator champion <strong>Yaroslav Amosov</strong> making a statement in his continued UFC run against the always-tough <strong>Neil Magny</strong>. <strong>Amosov</strong> wasted no time showing why he was a champion in his previous promotion, immediately imposing his grappling prowess on the veteran Magny.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Just over three minutes into the opening round, <strong>Amosov</strong> secured an anaconda choke that forced <strong>Magny</strong> to tap at 3:14 of the first round. The submission victory was a clear demonstration of Amosov's high-level grappling and his ability to finish even experienced UFC veterans. For <strong>Magny</strong>, a perennial gatekeeper in the welterweight division, it was another setback in what has been a long and respected UFC career.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With this impressive finish, <strong>Amosov</strong> continues to prove he belongs among the elite welterweights in the UFC. The former Bellator champion should be matched up against a ranked opponent next to see how he fares against the top tier of the division. As for <strong>Magny</strong>, he remains a valuable test for up-and-coming fighters, though his days of contending for a title shot appear to be behind him.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="joanderson-brito-vs-isaac-thomson">
        <h3>Joanderson Brito vs. Isaac Thomson</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>This featherweight matchup between <strong>Joanderson Brito</strong> and <strong>Isaac Thomson</strong> went the full 15 minutes, with <strong>Brito</strong> earning a unanimous decision victory. The fight showcased Brito's ability to control the pace and outwork his opponent over three rounds.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Throughout the bout, <strong>Brito</strong> demonstrated superior conditioning and fight IQ, consistently finding ways to edge out exchanges and accumulate points on the judges' scorecards. <strong>Thomson</strong> showed toughness and durability but was unable to implement his own game plan effectively enough to sway the judges. The unanimous nature of the decision indicated that Brito's performance was clear and convincing across all three rounds.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With this victory, <strong>Brito</strong> continues to build his resume in the featherweight division and should be matched against increasingly difficult competition. For <strong>Thomson</strong>, the loss serves as a learning experience, and he'll need to make adjustments before his next octagon appearance to remain competitive in the stacked 145-pound weight class.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="steven-asplund-vs-sean-sharaf">
        <h3>Steven Asplund vs. Sean Sharaf</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Punches (Standing TKO) at 3:49 Round 2 of 3, 8:49 Total</p>
        <p>This heavyweight clash between UFC newcomer <strong>Steven Asplund</strong> and <strong>Sean Sharaf</strong> delivered the kind of violence expected from the division. <strong>Asplund</strong>, who is 6-1 overall, was making his UFC debut after winning his matchup against Anthony Guarascio on Dana White's Contender Series back in September. <strong>Sharaf</strong>, sitting at 4-1, had made his UFC debut against Junior Tafa back in 2024 and was looking to get back on track with a victory. The matchup represented the UFC's clear effort to inject new talent into a heavyweight division that has lacked depth in recent years.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The opening round was an absolute war. Both heavyweights came out slugging in the center of the octagon. <strong>Sharaf</strong> appeared to land two really big rights that hurt <strong>Asplund</strong>, but both men kept pushing forward. <strong>Asplund</strong> was much more active, attempting to land higher volume and longer combinations, while Sharaf focused on landing fewer but more devastating power shots. Then <strong>Asplund</strong> split Sharaf really badly over his left eye with a left jab, and blood began pouring everywhere. With the cut opened, <strong>Asplund</strong> immediately began targeting it, turning Sharaf's face completely red. Asplund connected with a right hand that pushed Sharaf against the cage. In a bizarre moment, Asplund threw a kick and slipped, but <strong>Sharaf</strong> was so badly hurt that he couldn't capitalize on the opportunity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The second round saw <strong>Sharaf</strong> land a big right and push <strong>Asplund</strong> against the cage, but Asplund maintained his composure, separated, and returned to the center of the octagon. <strong>Asplund</strong> continued to pour it on, clearly targeting the gruesome cut on Sharaf's face. <strong>Sharaf</strong> was completely messed up, and eventually, the punishment became too much. The referee stepped in to wave off the fight at 3:49 of the second round, giving <strong>Asplund</strong> a standing TKO victory in his UFC debut.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Sharaf</strong> proved himself to be insanely tough, taking massive punishment throughout both rounds, but the cut ultimately dictated the outcome. Both fighters showed the heart and durability expected from heavyweights, though <strong>Asplund's</strong> higher output and ability to capitalize on the cut earned him the victory. For <strong>Asplund</strong>, this was an impressive debut that should earn him another opportunity in the octagon against similarly leveled competition. <strong>Sharaf</strong> will need time to heal and regroup before returning, but his toughness ensures he'll remain a fixture in the heavyweight division.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="fight" id="luana-santos-vs-melissa-croden">
        <h3>Luana Santos vs. Melissa Croden</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>This women's bantamweight matchup featured <strong>Luana Santos</strong>, ranked 15th in the division, against <strong>Melissa Croden</strong> in what was essentially a test for both fighters. <strong>Santos</strong> had been in the UFC since 2023 and boasted a 3-1 record in the promotion, with her only loss coming against Casey O'Neill. She had gotten back on track earlier in 2025 with a win over Lisboa. <strong>Croden</strong>, sitting at 7-2 overall, had made her UFC debut in Vancouver back in October with a victory over that same Lisboa opponent, and was making a quick turnaround looking to ride that momentum. With both women coming in with wins over Lisboa, this matchup would determine who was ready to face tougher competition near the top of the division.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The first round saw <strong>Santos</strong> immediately implement her grappling game, getting <strong>Croden</strong> to the ground early and securing a nasty position with a headlock. Santos began landing headshots from on top as Croden struggled beneath her. <strong>Croden</strong> showed good composure, managing to maneuver around to Santos's back and sneak in a hook before eventually freeing her head. They separated and returned to the center of the octagon, where Santos attempted a trip on Croden but was unsuccessful, leading to a clinch against the cage.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The second round began with both fighters trading on the feet, though neither landed significant shots in the striking exchanges. <strong>Santos</strong> once again got <strong>Croden</strong> to the ground and achieved mount position. While Croden was unable to return to her feet, Santos didn't do anything particularly spectacular from top position, content to control and accumulate points.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the third round, <strong>Santos</strong> secured a clinch against the cage, but <strong>Croden</strong> was able to separate and began to piece Santos up on the feet. However, <strong>Santos</strong> took Croden down once more and trapped her in a headlock in the center of the octagon. Santos landed shots from on top while Croden spun around trying to escape, ending the fight spinning helplessly around the octagon.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There wasn't much to say about this fight—it was a pretty dull affair that <strong>Luana Santos</strong> dominated from start to finish. Surprisingly, two judges scored it 29-28, though it's unclear which round could be given to <strong>Croden</strong>. Santos needs to improve her striking significantly, as the elite fighters in this division like Amanda Nunes and Kayla Harrison can mix it up both standing and on the ground. If Santos can only grapple, she won't be able to compete for a top contender spot. For <strong>Croden</strong>, at 35 years old, this was clearly too much too soon. While she's older, she's still relatively young in her UFC tenure, and she would benefit from getting more bouts under her belt against lower-level competition before stepping up again.</p>

        <p>This heavyweight bout featured a rare matchup between two undefeated prospects making their UFC debuts. <strong>Allen Frye</strong>, sitting at 6-0, and <strong>Guilherme Pat</strong>, boasting a 5-0 record, were both stepping into the octagon for the first time. What made this matchup particularly unusual was that neither fighter had even competed on the Contender Series—a testament to the UFC's desperation to find heavyweight talent in a division that has struggled with depth in recent years.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The opening round saw <strong>Frye</strong> immediately eager to engage in grappling, pushing <strong>Pat</strong> against the fence. <strong>Pat</strong> absorbed an elbow or two but was ultimately able to separate and bring the fight back to the center of the octagon. Once there, Pat began landing power shots on Frye in the center. After taking punishment and bleeding under his left eye, <strong>Frye</strong> managed to get the fight back against the cage. <strong>Pat</strong> separated again and returned to striking, where Frye was unable to throw significant shots and became practically a punching bag. Frye got the fight into the clinch once more, pushing Pat back against the cage, but <strong>Pat</strong> separated yet again and stung Frye with a counter right.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The second round started with both men back in the clinch against the cage, with each fighter jockeying for position. They separated and <strong>Pat</strong> immediately began laying into <strong>Frye</strong>, who showed poor defensive reactions. <strong>Frye</strong> got the fight back to the clinch against the cage once more. When they separated again, Pat continued piecing up Frye with strikes. Frye returned to the clinch—at this point, it almost felt like desperation rather than strategy, which was not a good look for the undefeated prospect.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The third round opened with <strong>Pat</strong> landing nasty elbows and more power shots on the feet. <strong>Frye</strong> secured the clinch against the cage and began rubbing his face against Pat, leaving Pat completely bloodied up. The remainder of the fight followed the same pattern: Pat landing big shots whenever they were separated, and Frye desperately trying to clinch and avoid further damage.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Allen Frye</strong> proved to be insanely tough, but he doesn't appear to have any real offensive weapons. He's not skilled enough at grappling to take opponents to the ground, not good enough to outstrike his opponents, and isn't lethal in the clinch. <strong>Guilherme Pat</strong>, on the other hand, was nasty. He completely messed up Frye in an impressive UFC debut. However, there's a question about how much power Pat actually possesses in his hands. He was landing repeatedly on Frye but was never able to finish him—it could be that he isn't as much of a power puncher as he appears, or Frye simply has an iron chin. Before putting Pat up against top-15 opponents, it would be wise to see him against similarly leveled competition to better gauge his true abilities. Regardless, this was a strong debut that should earn him another opportunity to prove himself in the heavyweight division.</p>

        <h3>Jamey-Lyn Horth vs. Tereza Bledá</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Right Hook and Follow Up Punches at 2:05 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>This women's flyweight bout kicked off the main card and featured two fighters looking to position themselves for a ranked opponent. <strong>Tereza Bledá</strong>, a 7-1 fighter with two UFC bouts under her belt, entered with a 1-1 record in the promotion. She had lost her debut to flyweight top contender Natalia Silva but bounced back with a win over Gabriella Fernandez. However, the past two years had not been kind to Bledá—she hadn't fought in the second half of 2023 or 2024, and this marked her first appearance in 2025. Plagued by injuries and infections that kept her out of the octagon, the 24-year-old faced serious questions about whether her extended layoff would impact her performance. <strong>Jamey-Lyn Horth</strong>, meanwhile, had joined the UFC around the same time as Bledá in 2023 but had been much more active. The 35-year-old Canadian boasted an 8-2 record overall and had gone 2-2 since joining the promotion. A win for either woman would position her for a matchup with a ranked opponent in her next bout.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The fight began with <strong>Bledá</strong> engaging the grappling early, holding <strong>Horth</strong> against the cage while clutching a single leg. <strong>Horth</strong> managed to separate and immediately began landing heavy shots on the feet. The striking proved decisive—<strong>Horth</strong> connected with a right hook followed by punishing ground strikes, forcing the referee to step in and award her the TKO finish at 2:05 of the first round.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Bledá's</strong> inactivity has clearly prevented her from progressing in the sport. She needs to work on developing her game beyond just grappling. Ultimately, relying solely on grappling in modern MMA is comparable to bringing a knife to a gunfight—you need to be well-rounded to compete at this level. <strong>Horth</strong> looked great tonight. She kept her composure when Bledá pushed her against the cage and was ultimately able to separate and get the job done. With this impressive performance, Horth has earned herself a shot at someone in the rankings next. Her veteran savvy and ability to stay calm under pressure should serve her well as she continues climbing the flyweight ladder.</p>
