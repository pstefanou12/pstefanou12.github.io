      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>UFC Fight Night: Bautista vs. Oliveira was a mixed bag from the Apex — a card that delivered a handful of memorable moments buried under a frustrating amount of clinching, stalling, and uninspiring decision fights. While the main event and co-main gave fans something to feel good about, the undercard was a chore to sit through at times, highlighting the ongoing issue of burying quality fighters on low-profile Apex cards.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The evening's best performances came from fighters who left no doubt. <strong>Mario Bautista</strong> put on a masterclass of grappling dominance in the main event, completely neutralizing the hyped <strong>Vinicius Oliveira</strong> before finishing him with a rear naked choke in the second round. It was the kind of suffocating, technically brilliant performance that announced Bautista as a legitimate contender at bantamweight. In the co-main, <strong>Kyoji Horiguchi</strong> turned back the clock with a sharp, speed-driven unanimous decision over <strong>Amir Albazi</strong>, making a compelling case for a flyweight title shot and reminding everyone that the 35-year-old MMA legend still has plenty left in the tank.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There were also bright spots scattered throughout the card. <strong>Cong Wang</strong> showcased her devastating power in a back-and-forth war with <strong>Eduarda Moura</strong>, and <strong>Michał Oleksiejczuk</strong> survived a gutsy comeback effort from <strong>Marc-André Barriault</strong> to pick up a hard-fought decision. The <strong>Jakub Wikłacz</strong> vs. <strong>Muin Gafurov</strong> fight provided genuine drama with an absurd buzzer-beater guillotine finish that had to be reviewed on instant replay.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Unfortunately, the card also featured some genuinely painful stretches. <strong>Bruna Brasil</strong> vs. <strong>Ketlen Souza</strong> was borderline unwatchable, with Herb Dean forced to repeatedly separate the fighters from the fence in a bout defined by aimless clinching and abysmal strike output. <strong>Rizvan Kuniev</strong> vs. <strong>Jailton Almeida</strong> was similarly tedious, as Kuniev used non-stop clinching to grind out a decision that somehow earned him two 30-27 scorecards despite being the more boring fighter in a matchup against one of the division's most notorious grapplers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The card also raised a bigger-picture issue about the UFC's handling of the flyweight division. A fighter like <strong>Horiguchi</strong> — an MMA legend with a story tailor-made for a title run — should not be headlining Apex cards. If the UFC wants fans to care about flyweight, they need to stop burying their best fighters on cards with minimal exposure. Number one contender fights should not take place in the Apex, period. Having more fans in the building did help the atmosphere compared to some past Apex shows, but the overall energy was still a far cry from what an arena crowd brings.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Final Score: 6.3/10</strong></p>
        <br>

        <h3>Mario Bautista vs. Vinicius Oliveira</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Rear Naked Choke at 4:46 Round 2 of 5, 9:46 Total</p>
        <p class="fight-prediction"></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Mario Bautista</strong> delivered an absolutely dominant performance in the main event, submitting <strong>Vinicius Oliveira</strong> with a rear naked choke in the second round to make a loud statement at bantamweight. Oliveira entered the fight riding a wave of hype off highlight-reel finishes, but Bautista exposed him as a fighter who crumbles when forced to grapple at the highest level.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          From the opening bell, it was all Bautista. After some initial calf kicks and a brief clinch exchange, Bautista secured a takedown and immediately advanced to mount, where he began raining down nasty hammerfists. The first round was a complete shutout, with Oliveira having no answer for Bautista's relentless pressure and top control.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The second round was more of the same. Bautista again took Oliveira down early, and whenever Oliveira managed to scramble back to his feet, Bautista promptly dragged him right back to the canvas. Oliveira managed to sneak in an elbow on a break, but Bautista remained calm, composed, and in total control. The Brazilian looked completely gassed from all the grappling — his cardio was simply not up to the task. Bautista got Oliveira back to the mat, worked into a crucifix position, and began unloading elbows. He then seamlessly transitioned to Oliveira's back and sunk in the rear naked choke to end the fight.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          This was a statement performance from Bautista, and it forces us to reconsider some recent results. Perhaps we wrote off Patchy Mix's loss to Bautista a little too quickly — Mario is the real deal. His grappling was absolutely suffocating, and he showed the kind of finishing instinct that title contenders need. Bautista called out <strong>Cory Sandhagen</strong> after the fight, a rematch of their 2019 bout where Sandhagen submitted Bautista in the first round. Given the clear improvement Bautista has made since then, it would be fascinating to see how that rematch plays out. As for Oliveira, the hype train has been thoroughly derailed. He needs to go back and fight opponents outside of the rankings to rebuild — he is simply not ready for the top of bantamweight.

      <div class="fight" id="kyoji-horiguchi-vs-amir-albazi">
        <h3>Kyoji Horiguchi vs. Amir Albazi</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p class="fight-prediction"></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Kyoji Horiguchi</strong> put on a striking clinic against <strong>Amir Albazi</strong>, using his speed and footwork to cruise to a unanimous decision victory in the co-main event. The Japanese MMA legend — who once challenged Demetrious Johnson for the flyweight title and went on to become a champion in both Rizin and Bellator — showed that at 35, he still has the tools to compete with the best in the world.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The speed difference between the two fighters was apparent from the start. Horiguchi was light on his feet, circling the octagon with the kind of movement that Albazi simply could not match. Whenever Albazi tried to close the distance, Horiguchi would crack him with quick combinations and circle away before Albazi could respond. Albazi's only moments of success came in the clinch against the cage, but even there he could not hold Horiguchi for any significant period of time. In the second round, Horiguchi landed a big right that badly stumbled Albazi, a moment that seemed to break whatever remained of Albazi's confidence.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          By the third round, Albazi had been reduced to desperately clinching against the fence, unable to implement any gameplan. He was too slow to trade on the feet, too weak in the grappling to hold Horiguchi down, and too compromised by the accumulating damage to mount any kind of sustained offense. Horiguchi continued to stalk his prey, landing another massive left that stumbled Albazi badly and underscoring just how one-sided the contest had become.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The flyweight division is shaping up to be genuinely interesting right now. With contenders like Pantoja, Taira, Horiguchi, and Kape all in the mix, there are compelling matchups everywhere. Given Kape's inactivity, he is likely at the back of the line, which means a Horiguchi vs. Taira number one contender fight could make sense — perhaps on a card in Japan, or on the same card as a Pantoja title defense. As for Albazi, it is hard to know where he goes from here. His medical complications have limited his activity, and at this point, stepping away to prioritize his long-term health may be the wisest decision. The story of Horiguchi returning to the UFC to finally finish what he started against DJ all those years ago is the kind of narrative the sport needs — but it will only resonate if the UFC stops burying him on Apex cards.

      <div class="fight" id="rizvan-kuniev-vs-jailton-almeida">
        <h3>Rizvan Kuniev vs. Jailton Almeida</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p class="fight-prediction"></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Rizvan Kuniev</strong> ground out a unanimous decision victory over <strong>Jailton Almeida</strong>, but this was far from an impressive performance. In fact, to walk into a fight against one of the most boring grapplers in the heavyweight division and somehow come out as the more boring fighter is a remarkable achievement in the wrong direction.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The first round set the tone for what would be a tedious fifteen minutes. Almeida immediately shot for a takedown, but Kuniev used the cage to stay on his feet and reverse position. What followed was an endless cycle of clinching against the fence, with Dan Miragliotta repeatedly separating the fighters to try and generate some action. To his credit, Kuniev was the busier fighter in the clinch, landing knees and punches to the body, while Almeida seemed content to just stand there and hold on. Whenever they returned to the center, Almeida would shoot another takedown that Kuniev would deny, and they would end up right back on the fence.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The second round saw Almeida make some adjustments, coming out with more striking and landing some decent kicks to the body and clean 1-2 combinations. Kuniev was visibly tiring, which pushed him back to his clinching strategy against the cage. Almeida even complained to the referee about being held against the fence — an ironic protest from a fighter known for suffocating grappling. The third round was the most competitive, with Almeida fighting with genuine urgency and landing clean strikes in the open, but Kuniev continued to initiate clinches that Miragliotta would break up.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The two 30-27 scorecards in Kuniev's favor felt generous. Almeida arguably had the cleaner striking exchanges in the third round, and much of Kuniev's clinch work was effectively nullified by the referee's separations. It seems bizarre that Kuniev earned this opportunity after losing to Curtis Blaydes in his UFC debut. He should not be fighting a higher-ranked opponent next — a matchup against someone in the top 10 is needed to prove he actually belongs at this level, especially considering Almeida took this fight on short notice. Ironically, Almeida's stock may have actually gone up here. He showed legitimately improved striking, and with a bit more development in that area, he could be a real contender. A matchup with <strong>Sergei Pavlovich</strong> would make sense for his next outing.
        </p>

      <div class="fight" id="michał-oleksiejczuk-vs-marc-andré-barriault">
        <h3>Michał Oleksiejczuk vs. Marc-André Barriault</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p class="fight-prediction"></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Michał Oleksiejczuk</strong> earned a hard-fought unanimous decision over <strong>Marc-André Barriault</strong> in a fight that was far more competitive than it should have been. After nearly finishing Barriault in the opening round, Oleksiejczuk faded badly, raising real questions about his cardio and his ability to compete deeper in the middleweight rankings.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The first round was all Oleksiejczuk. After some initial hand fighting, the Polish fighter found his range and began walking Barriault down with heavy shots. A huge right hand wobbled the Canadian, and Oleksiejczuk swarmed, looking to close the show. Barriault survived the onslaught, showing tremendous heart by firing back with a right hand of his own that temporarily backed Oleksiejczuk off. But the round ended with Oleksiejczuk following Barriault to the canvas and hammering away with ground and pound — a clear 10-8 round by any reasonable standard.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          From the second round onward, however, the fight changed completely. Barriault came alive, advancing behind his own combinations and finding a home for shots in the clinch. Oleksiejczuk was visibly slowing down, his output dropping dramatically from the pace he set in the first five minutes. Both men exchanged body kicks and continued to trade leather, but it was clear that Oleksiejczuk's gas tank was running on empty. By the third round, both fighters looked exhausted, but they admirably continued to swing until the final bell in what became a genuine war of attrition.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          It was a tough loss for Barriault, who came to fight and showed real toughness recovering from a near-stoppage in the first. At middleweight, you simply cannot afford to take the opening round off — these fighters hit hard enough to end the fight at any moment, and the hole Barriault dug for himself was too deep to climb out of. For Oleksiejczuk, the win is a positive result, but this was not a good look for a fighter whose previous two bouts were first-round knockouts. The clear cardio issues that surfaced after the first round will be a serious problem against higher-ranked opposition. He called for a top 15 opponent, and he probably deserves the opportunity, but he will need to address his conditioning if he wants to survive five minutes against the division's elite.

      <div class="fight" id="farid-basharat-vs-jean-matsumoto">
        <h3>Farid Basharat vs. Jean Matsumoto</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Split at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p class="fight-prediction"></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Farid Basharat</strong> edged out <strong>Jean Matsumoto</strong> via split decision in a high-volume, back-and-forth contest that had fans in the building convinced the wrong man got his hand raised. This was a fight defined by frenetic grappling exchanges, constant clinch work, and a pace that made it genuinely difficult to score.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The first round saw Basharat gain the early advantage on the feet, clipping Matsumoto with clean shots and messing up the Brazilian's face. Matsumoto struggled to find his range with his strikes but stayed busy, and the round featured a prolonged clinch sequence against the cage. When Matsumoto managed to secure a takedown against the fence, Basharat quickly scrambled back to his feet, and they separated back to the center.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The second round was chaos. They traded clinch positions repeatedly, with Basharat landing a stinging right and a knee that seemed to hurt Matsumoto. But Matsumoto started to make the fight ugly, closing the distance and beginning to land his own shots to Basharat's face. The round also featured a blatant fence grab by Matsumoto during a takedown attempt that Herb Dean missed for an uncomfortably long time. Despite the foul, Matsumoto eventually completed the takedown, but Basharat scrambled beautifully and briefly ended up in mount before they returned to the feet. Basharat continued to find a home for his punches whenever they were standing.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The third round continued in the same vein — Matsumoto pushing for takedowns, Basharat landing on the feet, and both fighters engaging in wild scrambles that were nearly impossible to score. Basharat even landed a nice takedown of his own in the third, briefly taking mount before Matsumoto worked back to the fence. The crowd booed the decision at the end, many believing Matsumoto had done enough with his grappling. Basharat called out <strong>Deiveson Figueiredo</strong> after the fight, which feels like a stretch. A more realistic and compelling matchup would be <strong>Ricky Simon</strong>, giving Farid a chance to avenge the loss Simon handed to his brother Javid last year in Seattle. As for Matsumoto, he is close but not quite there yet — one more fight against an unranked opponent should clarify whether he truly belongs in the bantamweight rankings.

      <div class="fight" id="dustin-jacoby-vs-julius-walker">
        <h3>Dustin Jacoby vs. Julius Walker</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Punches at 1:42 Round 2 of 3, 6:42 Total</p>
        <p class="fight-prediction"></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Dustin Jacoby</strong> turned in a clean performance to finish the overhyped <strong>Julius Walker</strong> in the second round, extending his winning streak to three and making a case for a ranked opponent at light heavyweight.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The first round was a feeling-out process. Walker attempted an early takedown after eating some shots from Jacoby, who briefly threatened a guillotine before Walker escaped. Walker then used his athleticism to pick Jacoby up and carry him across the octagon, securing a takedown, but Jacoby popped right back to his feet. It was clear that Walker's power wrestling would not be enough to keep the veteran down.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The second round was short and decisive. Jacoby stung Walker early, sending him to the canvas. He followed Walker to the ground and began pouring on the ground and pound. Walker survived the initial barrage and was given a chance to recover, but Jacoby stayed patient and finished the job, earning the stoppage.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Walker was way too overhyped coming into this fight. He needs to be matched against lower-ranked light heavyweights to gain experience before being thrown in with the division's veterans. Meanwhile, Jacoby is now riding three straight wins and just handed an up-and-comer a significant learning experience — he deserves a step up in competition. A matchup against <strong>Nikita Krylov</strong> could make sense as a logical next step.

      <div class="fight" id="daniil-donchenko-vs-alex-morono">
        <h3>Daniil Donchenko vs. Alex Morono</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p class="fight-prediction"></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Daniil Donchenko</strong> picked apart <strong>Alex Morono</strong> over three rounds, systematically attacking the veteran's lead leg en route to a unanimous decision victory. Morono entered the fight with a visible brace on his knee, and Donchenko wasted no time targeting it with brutal precision.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The first round was a demolition job. Donchenko opened with three devastating kicks to Morono's braced knee that sent him to the canvas. Morono somehow bounced back to his feet and they ended up against the fence, where he landed a shot on the break. But Donchenko continued to land heavy strikes that visibly stunned Morono, and Keith Peterson had to stop the action at one point to warn Donchenko about his open fingers. A massive left hook dropped Morono again, and Donchenko followed him to the floor with ground and pound. Morono survived — barely — and managed to land a spinning back elbow at the bell that gave the crowd something to cheer about.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          From the second round onward, Donchenko's pace slowed considerably, exposing a clear cardio problem. He continued to chop at Morono's lead leg with heavy kicks, sending him down multiple times, but he lacked the finishing instinct to put the veteran away. Morono kept spamming spinning back elbows — one of which actually stunned Donchenko in the second round — but nothing else in his arsenal was landing with any consistency. The third round saw Morono throwing everything he could think of with little connecting, while Donchenko coasted on his early damage, punctuating the round with another left hook that dropped Morono and a final leg kick at the buzzer that sent him to the canvas one more time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Donchenko showed real power and good game-planning, but he is pretty sloppy overall. He keeps his hands low, has serious lapses in concentration that leave him vulnerable, and clearly does not have the gas tank to maintain his first-round output. This was an overall moral victory for Morono, who showed incredible toughness to survive the onslaught despite being physically outmatched. If the UFC wants to keep Morono around, the natural matchups present themselves from the earlier fights on this card: <strong>Niko Price</strong> vs. Morono in a rematch, and <strong>Donchenko</strong> vs. <strong>Nikolay Veretennikov</strong> to test whether either prospect is ready for a step up.
        </p>

        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Elbow and Punches (Standing TKO) at 1:42 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p class="fight-prediction"></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Nikolay Veretennikov</strong> made quick work of <strong>Niko Price</strong>, finishing the veteran with a nasty first-round stoppage that gave the card a much-needed highlight. This was a terrible pick from me going in — Price looked like he had absolutely no business being in there with Veretennikov from the moment the fight started.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Veretennikov caught Price with a clean right hand early as Price rushed in recklessly. They ended up in the clinch against the fence, where Veretennikov landed devastating knees that had Price out on his feet. A brutal knee to the face followed by nasty follow-up shots brought a merciful end to the contest.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Price will most likely be cut from the UFC after this performance, and it is hard to argue he deserves another opportunity. For Veretennikov, it was a good knockout on a card that desperately needed one, but there is not much information to be gained from beating a clearly overmatched opponent. He is a can crusher for now — we will need to see him against better competition before drawing any real conclusions about his ceiling.

        <p class="fight-prediction"></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ketlen Souza</strong> won a unanimous decision over <strong>Bruna Brasil</strong> in what was comfortably the worst fight of the night — a bout so devoid of action that Herb Dean was forced to separate the fighters from the fence multiple times across all three rounds. The significant strike output hovered around 15 total strikes per round between both fighters combined. That number speaks for itself.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The first round set the miserable tone. Brasil landed a nice right early that stunned Souza, but rather than capitalize, Souza immediately clinched against the fence and locked onto a single leg that went nowhere. Brasil circled the octagon and sniped from the outside while Souza repeatedly held her against the cage without inflicting any damage. Brasil landed some knees to the thighs on the inside, but eventually Herb Dean had seen enough and separated them.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The second and third rounds were more of the same. Souza used her boxing more in the second, landing a decent combination against the cage, but any time the fight threatened to become interesting, one of the fighters would initiate a clinch that led to absolutely nothing. Souza landed a shot in the second that clearly hurt Brasil's eye — she was visibly blinking and running from Souza for the remainder of the fight. Brasil threw a spinning back fist that connected but did no real damage. Souza finally completed a takedown in the third round, only to immediately let Brasil back to her feet. They ended up clinching against the fence again. Herb separated them again. The crowd suffered in silence.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          What was Souza's game plan in this fight? Shoot for takedowns in hopes of clinching against the fence? When she finally got the takedown in the third, she let Brasil right back up. It was a terrible fight, and frankly, neither fighter showed enough to warrant continued investment from viewers. Souza got the win, but it is hard to care about what comes next for either of them.

        <h3>Javid Basharat vs. Gianni Vazquez</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p class="fight-prediction"></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Javid Basharat</strong> ground out a unanimous decision over short-notice debutant <strong>Gianni Vazquez</strong> in a fight that was far more competitive than anyone expected. Given that Vazquez took the fight on short notice and was making his UFC debut, most assumed Basharat would make easy work of the newcomer. Instead, Vazquez showed he belongs in the promotion.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The first round was the most exciting of the three. Basharat worked his leg kicks early to establish range, while Vazquez moved big distances forward to try and land hooks. Basharat then countered beautifully with a left followed by a clean right hook that sent Vazquez crashing to the canvas. He followed Vazquez to the ground and came close to finishing the fight, but Vazquez showed tremendous heart and survived the barrage. They returned to the feet and the round ended without further incident.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The second round was a wild affair on both ends. Basharat opened with a spinning elbow as Vazquez charged forward, but the Mexican shook it off. Vazquez then landed a big right that put Basharat on the ground, showing he had power of his own. They traded positions on the mat in a scramble-heavy sequence — Vazquez nearly locked in an armbar and then threatened a heel hook, while Basharat eventually worked into mount and closed the round with solid ground and pound.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The third round saw Basharat lean on his grappling to secure the win. He dragged Vazquez down after a failed guillotine attempt, worked into side control, and wore on him with positional dominance. Vazquez tried desperately to get back to his feet in the closing moments, but Basharat took his back and controlled the action until the final bell. It was a smart, safe win from Basharat, but definitely not something that was interesting to watch. This fight solidifies what we already suspected: Basharat is a solid but unspectacular bantamweight who is not going to crack the top of the division. Vazquez, on the other hand, looked solid for a short-notice debutant and deserves another crack in the promotion.

      <div class="fight" id="cong-wang-vs-eduarda-moura">
        <h3>Cong Wang vs. Eduarda Moura</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p class="fight-prediction"></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cong Wang</strong> showcased her terrifying striking power in a back-and-forth war with <strong>Eduarda Moura</strong>, earning a unanimous decision in one of the more entertaining fights on the card. This was a classic striker vs. grappler matchup, and while Wang's power ultimately proved to be the difference, Moura's relentless grappling made this far more competitive than the scorecards might suggest.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Moura came out aggressively from the start, chasing Wang around the octagon and refusing to let the Chinese striker settle into a rhythm. She caught a Wang body kick and used it to close the distance, eventually dragging the fight to the ground. Moura secured a takedown and maintained control, but Wang kept fighting back to her feet. They ended up clinched against the cage, with Wang eventually shaking Moura off her back. Then came the moment that defined the fight — Wang landed a thunderous right hand that sent Moura crashing to the canvas. Wang followed her to the ground and unleashed a barrage of hammerfists so vicious it was a miracle the fight was not stopped right then and there.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The damage from that first round proved to be the decisive factor. Moura gamely shifted to a grappling-heavy approach in the second round, taking Wang down and getting into mount with a body triangle. She threatened an arm triangle and later took Wang's back, even locking in a rear naked choke that Wang somehow survived. But Moura simply could not inflict enough damage from these dominant positions, and Wang's toughness allowed her to weather the storm.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          By the third round, Wang took control for good. Moura went for a takedown but Wang ended up on top, and when they returned to the feet, Wang landed nasty shots that sent Moura down again. She took Moura's back and spent the rest of the round wearing on her. Wang has genuinely frightening striking, but her grappling remains a clear weakness. Given her current skillset, it is hard to see her beating someone like <strong>Valentina Shevchenko</strong>, who has the kind of stifling wrestling that would keep Wang on the ground for 25 minutes. Still, a fight against a top 10 ranked opponent makes sense for Wang next. As for Moura, the damage she absorbed in the first round was simply too much to overcome — she needed to commit to grappling from the opening bell rather than trying to chase Wang on the feet.

      <div class="fight" id="jakub-wikłacz-vs-muin-gafurov">
        <h3>Jakub Wikłacz vs. Muin Gafurov</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Mounted Guillotine Choke at 4:59 Round 3 of 3, 14:59 Total</p>
        <p class="fight-prediction"></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Jakub Wikłacz</strong> pulled off one of the most dramatic finishes of the year, sinking in a guillotine choke at the literal buzzer to submit <strong>Muin Gafurov</strong> in a fight that Gafurov had all but won. It was a buzzer-beater so close that officials had to review the replay to confirm the tap came before the bell. An entertaining fight with a crazy ending — and a devastating result born entirely from one man's terrible decision-making.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The first round was competitive on the feet. Wikłacz came out busy with kicks, pushing Gafurov to the fence and getting his corner fired up. Gafurov settled in and started landing his own strikes, including a big elbow in the clinch. Wikłacz used body kicks effectively to keep distance, but Gafurov's combinations looked dangerous whenever he closed the gap. The round ended with Gafurov holding Wikłacz against the fence and then firing off a big flurry that seemed to put him ahead on the cards.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The second round was where Wikłacz had his best stretch. He opened with an explosive jump kick to the body that stumbled Gafurov, then took him down and secured side control. From there, Wikłacz landed nasty elbows to the face and devastating knees to the ribs. Gafurov eventually scrambled back to his feet and reversed position, but a subsequent takedown attempt went wrong — Wikłacz ended up in mount, took the back, locked in a body triangle, and nearly finished with a rear naked choke that Gafurov barely survived.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Entering the third round, Gafurov was clearly winning on the scorecards. He was landing bigger shots on the feet, digging to the body, and generally controlling the pace of the fight. With about 30 seconds left and a 29-28 decision firmly in hand, Gafurov inexplicably shot for a takedown against the fence — the one area where Wikłacz had dominated all night. What followed was pure MMA chaos: Wikłacz locked in the guillotine, and Gafurov tapped at 4:59 of the third round. Literal seconds from victory, and he gift-wrapped the fight to his opponent.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          What was Gafurov thinking? He had the fight won. All he had to do was stay on his feet for 30 more seconds and he walks away with a clear decision victory. Instead, he put himself in the one position where Wikłacz had been dangerous all fight. It was a devastating loss driven by terrible decision-making. Looking ahead, Wikłacz's boxing is genuinely awful — he relies on spamming kicks to keep opponents at range so he does not get pieced up with combinations. If he does not improve his hands, he will not go far in the UFC. Gafurov has reasonable boxing, but his long looping punches leave him exposed when closing the distance. Both fighters have clear developmental work ahead of them.

      <div class="fight" id="klaudia-syguła-vs-priscila-cachoeira">
        <h3>Klaudia Syguła vs. Priscila Cachoeira</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p class="fight-prediction"></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Klaudia Syguła</strong> picked apart <strong>Priscila Cachoeira</strong> over three rounds, using superior footwork and volume to earn a clear unanimous decision in the card opener. It was not a spectacular performance, but Syguła did exactly what she needed to do against an aging, one-dimensional opponent who had no business being in there.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The women started swinging immediately, trading strikes in the center of the octagon. Syguła quickly drew blood, opening a small nick under Cachoeira's right eye. From there, the difference in approach became clear: Syguła circled the octagon intelligently, landing a couple of strikes before moving out of range, while Cachoeira remained flat-footed in the center, looking to land one big shot that would change the fight. Cachoeira did land one big strike that stumbled Syguła, but Syguła ate it well and rallied back with combinations of her own. By the end of the first round, Cachoeira's face was already red and bloody.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The second round featured a wild flurry from both women early, with both landing big shots. Syguła lost her mouthpiece and Keith Peterson stopped the action briefly. The overall output dropped in this round, but Syguła continued to find the target more consistently. Cachoeira landed a big jab that stumbled Syguła and followed up with a right, but Syguła recovered quickly. By now, both women were wearing damage on their faces.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The third round was a slow fade to the finish. Syguła continued to stay at range, but the output dropped considerably from both fighters. Cachoeira had almost no offense left, effectively becoming a punching bag with a good chin. She attempted to chop away at Syguła's legs with kicks that seemed to cause some pain, and Syguła shot for a brief takedown that was shucked off. Cachoeira landed some big shots in the waning moments while chasing Syguła around the octagon, but she was unable to cut off the cage. The fight ended with Syguła going to the ground and keeping Cachoeira away with up kicks.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Cachoeira is 37, and it showed throughout this fight. Her reactions are slow, she cannot close the distance quickly, she cannot evade punches, and she does not have the cardio or footwork to move around the octagon effectively. Watching older fighters get slaughtered is not enjoyable for anyone — Cachoeira should seriously consider retirement at this point. As for Syguła, she looked good early but her output dropped off drastically as the fight progressed, likely due to the calf damage Cachoeira inflicted. She needs to be given more bottom-ranked opponents to develop before thinking about ranked competition.
