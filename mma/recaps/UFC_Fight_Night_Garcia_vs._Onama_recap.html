      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The UFC APEX hosted a fight card that promised fireworks but delivered more controversy than classic moments. In a night marred by questionable officiating and debatable decisions, Steve Garcia emerged as the clear standout with a dominant first-round knockout victory in the main event.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        While Garcia's performance provided the evening's highlight, the co-main event between Waldo Cortes-Acosta and Ante Delija was overshadowed by a controversial eye poke that went unpunished, setting the tone for a card where referee decisions often overshadowed the in-cage action. The women's bantamweight bout between Norma Dumont and Ketlen Vieira ended in what many observers considered a clear robbery, adding to the night's frustrating narrative.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The preliminary card featured several fighters battling for their UFC futures, with Livia Alencar's impressive submission victory standing out among the undercard action. However, the lack of stakes in the fights, stars on the card, and energy in the Apex prevented this from being a memorable event, ultimately earning a disappointing 5.6/10 rating.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="main-card">Main Card</h2>
      
      <div class="fight" id="steve-garcia-vs-david-onama">
        <h3>Steve Garcia vs. David Onama</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Punches at 3:34 Round 1 of 5</p>
        <p>
          The featherweight main event featured two streaking contenders on the verge of breaking into the division's upper echelon. Steve Garcia entered riding a five-fight winning streak, with four of those victories coming by devastating knockout. Across the octagon stood David Onama, who had quietly compiled his own four-fight win streak, though all had come via decision, raising questions about his finishing ability against elite competition.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          From the opening bell, Garcia established his dominance, stalking Onama with calculated aggression. He found his range early, landing crisp left hands that immediately had Onama in trouble. The volume and precision of Garcia's striking proved overwhelming as Onama struggled to mount any meaningful offense beyond occasional leg kicks.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The end came swiftly when Garcia connected with a perfectly timed left hand that sent Onama crashing to the canvas. While Onama showed heart by surviving the initial impact, he was clearly compromised, covering up without intelligently defending himself as Garcia poured on ground strikes. Referee Herb Dean's late stoppage drew criticism from commentators and fans alike, as the fight could have been halted sooner to prevent unnecessary damage.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          In his post-fight interview, Garcia made a puzzling callout of Max Holloway for the BMF title, despite competing in a different weight class. While the callout may have missed the mark, Garcia's performance certainly warrants a step up in competition, with matchups against established contenders like Arnold Allen or Jean Silva making logical sense for his next challenge.
        </p>
        <br>
      </div>
      
      <div class="fight" id="waldo-cortes-acosta-vs-ante-delija">
        <h3>Waldo Cortes-Acosta vs. Ante Delija</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Jab-cross to Ground Punches at 3:59 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>
          The heavyweight co-main event carried significant implications beyond the immediate result, thanks to Delija's training relationship with current champion Tom Aspinall. The champion had publicly stated he would vacate his title rather than face his training partner, creating a potential dilemma for the UFC should Delija continue his winning ways.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The fight began with typical heavyweight caution before Delija secured an early takedown and began unleashing heavy ground strikes. As Cortes-Acosta covered up against the fence, replays clearly showed Delija landing a significant eye poke that went unnoticed by the officials. The foul proved consequential, as Delija continued his assault on the compromised fighter without point deduction.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          After a timeout to check Cortes-Acosta's vision, the fight resumed with dramatic immediacy. "Salsa Boy" channeled his frustration into a perfectly placed right hand that sent Delija crashing to the canvas, avenging both the earlier damage and the unpunished foul in spectacular fashion.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The victory not only keeps Cortes-Acosta relevant in the heavyweight division but also conveniently avoids the Aspinall-Delija training partner dilemma for the UFC. Given his performance under adversity, Cortes-Acosta deserves a step up in competition, with a matchup against Alexander Volkov representing an appropriate next challenge.
        </p>

      <div class="fight" id="jeremiah-wells-vs-themba-gorimbo">
        <h3>Jeremiah Wells vs. Themba Gorimbo</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>
          Both welterweights entered this contest at career crossroads, with Wells fighting for his UFC future after consecutive losses and Gorimbo looking to rebound from what many considered a fluke loss to Vicente Luque that snapped his four-fight win streak.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The fight delivered relentless action from the opening bell, with Gorimbo immediately imposing his wrestling game. Wells showed his veteran savvy by surviving early adversity and even ending the first round in a dominant position after multiple thrilling scrambles. The second frame saw both men trading heavy leather on the feet, with Wells threatening multiple submissions that showcased his underrated grappling chops.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          As the fight progressed, Wells began to take control, utilizing his power striking to back Gorimbo up and capitalizing on his opponent's fading gas tank. The third round saw Wells nearly secure a fight-ending arm triangle, demonstrating his evolution as a complete mixed martial artist who can finish fights anywhere the action goes.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          While neither fighter emerged with their hand raised in spectacular fashion, both enhanced their stock in a competitive welterweight division. Wells' callouts of Mike Malott, Jake Matthews, and Michael Chiesa post-fight indicate his readiness for stiffer competition, though the latter matchup seems unlikely given Chiesa's current trajectory.

          <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Somethng is going on with Duglarian vs Del Valle.

        </div>
        <p>
          The bout between these two prospects was overshadowed by pre-fight controversy when DraftKings removed the matchup from their platform due to suspicious betting line movement. Del Valle entered as an undefeated Cuban sensation, while Dulgarian looked to rebound from his first career loss against Christian Rodriguez.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Dulgarian's gameplan immediately raised eyebrows as he shot for an early takedown against the dangerous grappler. Del Valle defended expertly, transitioning immediately to a guillotine attempt before taking dominant position. What followed was a grappling masterclass from the Cuban prospect, who seamlessly advanced through positions while threatening multiple submissions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Despite Dulgarian's valiant defense, Del Valle's technical superiority proved insurmountable. The eventual rear naked choke finish showcased why many consider Del Valle one of the most promising prospects in the featherweight division, though questions remain about Dulgarian's strategic approach given his opponent's known strengths.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          At 10-0 with two UFC victories, Del Valle deserves increased competition, though it's premature for a ranked opponent. The suspicious betting activity and Dulgarian's questionable tactics will undoubtedly fuel speculation about this fight's circumstances in the coming weeks.
        </p>

      <div class="fight" id="charles-radtke-vs-daniel-frunza">
        <h3>Charles Radtke vs. Daniel Frunza</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Rear Naked Choke at 4:29 Round 3 of 3, 14:29 Total</p>
        <p>
          Coming off a disappointing loss to Mike Malott, Radtke faced significant pressure to rebound against Frunza, who had been dominated in his UFC debut and appeared to be fighting for his roster spot.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Radtke established his gameplan immediately, taking the fight to the ground and working methodically toward dominant positions. The first round nearly ended in spectacular fashion when Radtke secured a tight rear naked choke that Frunza somehow survived, displaying incredible heart and durability under duress.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          As the fight progressed, it became apparent that Frunza lacked the urgency or skillset to change the bout's trajectory. Radtke continued his grappling dominance through the second and third rounds, finally securing the submission with just thirty seconds remaining in the fight.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          While the victory gets Radtke back in the win column, Frunza's passive performance suggests he may not be UFC caliber. Radtke should face lower-level competition before another ranked test, with Kevin Holland representing the upper limit of appropriate opposition at this stage of his development.

        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Anaconda Choke at 3:13 Round 2 of 3, 8:13 Total</p>
        <p>
          The flyweight contest featured two fighters on very different trajectories, with Nascimento riding a three-fight win streak despite persistent inactivity issues, while Durden entered on two weeks' notice fighting for his UFC career amid a two-fight losing skid.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Durden started aggressively, pressuring Nascimento and winning the early striking exchanges with crisp combinations. The Brazilian appeared hesitant initially, backing up consistently as Durden marched forward with purpose. However, the momentum shifted dramatically in the second round when Nascimento found his timing and range.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The finishing sequence began with a perfectly placed right elbow that dropped Durden abruptly. Showing the instincts of a seasoned finisher, Nascimento immediately pounced on the anaconda choke opportunity, securing the submission and extending his win streak to four impressive victories.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Nascimento's callout of Steve Erceg post-fight represents a significant leap in competition that may be premature. A more measured step up against an established veteran like Bruno Silva would provide better assessment of his readiness for the division's upper echelon.

        <h3>Billy Elekana vs. Kevin Christian</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Submission, Rear Naked Choke at 3:33 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>
          Christian's UFC debut began promisingly, with his leg kicks immediately causing visible damage to Elekana's lead leg. However, the fight turned abruptly when Elekana landed a check right hook that sent Christian stumbling to the canvas.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          What followed was a sequence of concerning officiating, as Elekana landed multiple shots to the back of Christian's head before securing the fight-ending submission. Most alarming was the delayed stoppage, with Christian visibly tapping for several seconds before the referee intervened, leaving the debutant unconscious.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          While Elekana gets credit for the victory, the bout will be remembered for the dangerous officiating that put fighter safety at risk and highlighted the need for consistent referee standards across UFC events.

        <p>
          The bout showcased two prospects with contrasting styles, as Lee immediately resorted to his grappling-heavy approach while Cuamba looked to utilize his evolving striking game. Early success for Lee gave way to exhaustion as Cuamba's superior cardio and well-rounded skillset took over in the later rounds.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Cuamba's victory moves him to 2-2 in the UFC after a difficult start to his promotional tenure, demonstrating significant improvement in his grappling defense and fight IQ. Lee's one-dimensional approach and poor conditioning continue the concerning trend of Eastern Asian fighters struggling to adapt to the UFC's level of competition.

        <p>
          The undefeated Johnson maintained his perfect record and 100% finish rate with a dominant performance against the controversial Dumas, who took the fight on short notice. Despite early aggression from Johnson, Dumas briefly threatened with his grappling before the prospect's superior skills prevailed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Johnson's victory, while impressive, revealed areas for development in his defensive striking and cage awareness. Dumas' continued roster presence remains questionable given his professional record and ongoing outside-the-cage controversies.

        <p>
          In what many observers considered the night's clearest robbery, Dumont emerged with a controversial split decision victory over the typically dominant Vieira. The Brazilian controlled much of the action with her superior grappling and cage control, making the judges' scorecards particularly baffling.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The decision appears conveniently timed for the UFC's promotional plans, likely positioning Dumont for a future title shot while leaving Vieira to rebuild against lower-ranked competition in a division sorely lacking contenders.

        <p>
          Ardelean utilized her significant size advantage to control the action against an overmatched Ruiz, who showed heart but lacked the technical skills to compete effectively. The victory does little to establish Ardelean as a future contender in a thin division.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Ruiz's third consecutive loss likely signals the end of her UFC tenure, as she has demonstrated neither the skills nor activity level to justify continued roster placement in a promotion constantly seeking to upgrade its talent pool.

          Ko delivered a grappling clinic against the towering Rowe, repeatedly taking the fight to the mat and neutralizing Rowe's significant reach advantage. The victory establishes Ko as a legitimate prospect in the welterweight division, though questions remain about his finishing ability against higher-level competition.
        </p>

After surviving early striking exchanges, Alencar systematically broke down her opponent before securing the late submission.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          While Alencar's striking remains a concern against higher-level competition, her world-class grappling provides a foundation to build upon in a strawweight division always seeking fresh contenders.
