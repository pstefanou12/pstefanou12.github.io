      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>UFC 324 delivered a mixed bag of action, with the main event between <strong>Justin Gaethje</strong> and <strong>Paddy Pimblett</strong> serving as the clear highlight of an otherwise lackluster card. While the event produced several finishes on the prelims that brought energy to the early portions of the night, the main card struggled to maintain momentum outside of the headlining bout. The Paramount era officially began with this event, and the production changes were immediately noticeable—unfortunately not in a positive way. The excessive number of commercials disrupted the viewing experience, causing fans to miss crucial moments like fighter walkouts and corner advice between rounds, elements that had been staples of the ESPN broadcasts.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The card showcased some concerning trends across multiple divisions. The women's flyweight division appears to be in a state of stagnation, lacking compelling matchups or rising stars to generate excitement among fans. The bantamweight division remains in flux as well, with the title picture becoming increasingly murky. Moving forward, a rematch between <strong>Merab Dvalishvili</strong> and <strong>Petr Yan</strong> seems warranted, while a potential eliminator between <strong>Sean O'Malley</strong> and <strong>Umar Nurmagomedov</strong> could determine the next title challenger. Despite these organizational challenges, the event managed to produce moments of genuine excitement, particularly in the main event where both fighters displayed the kind of reckless abandon that makes for compelling television, even if it raises questions about their longevity in the sport.</p>

        <h3>Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 5 Rounds, 25:00 Total</p>
        <p>This was a clash between the battle-tested veteran and the promotional favorite, as <strong>Justin Gaethje</strong> sought his fourth opportunity at UFC gold against the polarizing <strong>Paddy "The Baddy" Pimblett</strong>. <strong>Gaethje</strong> entered the contest as a mainstay at the top of the lightweight division for nearly a decade, boasting an impressive 3-1 record in his last four fights with a recent victory over <strong>Rafael Fiziev</strong>. This represented what many believed would be <strong>Gaethje's</strong> final title shot after three previous attempts. Meanwhile, <strong>Pimblett</strong> found himself in the title picture under controversial circumstances, earning an interim title fight after defeating the remnants of <strong>Michael Chandler's</strong> career. Despite riding a seven-fight UFC winning streak, critics pointed to the hand-picked nature of his opposition, making this bout against a proven elite fighter his toughest test to date.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At the opening bell, <strong>Pimblett</strong> came out aggressively, throwing leg kicks before landing a significant right hand that initiated striking exchanges in the center of the octagon. <strong>Gaethje</strong> absorbed punishment before pressing <strong>Pimblett</strong> against the cage and dragging him to the canvas, where he delivered punishing ground and pound. When <strong>Gaethje</strong> allowed <strong>Pimblett</strong> to return to his feet, the Englishman appeared tentative, retreating and even attempting to draw <strong>Gaethje</strong> into his guard by falling from minimal contact. The round ended dramatically when <strong>Gaethje</strong> landed a classic eye poke that drew a stern warning, followed immediately by a right hook that hurt <strong>Pimblett</strong> badly, forcing him to clinch defensively.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The second round saw <strong>Gaethje</strong> continue his dominance, dragging <strong>Pimblett</strong> to the mat and landing a knee to the body. Though <strong>Pimblett</strong> returned to his feet and managed to land a shot on the break, <strong>Gaethje's</strong> stiff right hands kept finding their mark. <strong>Pimblett's</strong> kicks were consistently checked, sending him backward and to the canvas repeatedly. His striking became increasingly wild and uncontrolled as <strong>Gaethje</strong> dragged him down with a headlock before dropping him with a clean right hand and following up with vicious ground strikes. Replays would later reveal another eye poke from <strong>Gaethje</strong> during this exchange, though he escaped punishment because his fingers appeared closed, making it look like a legitimate punch.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Moving into the championship rounds, <strong>Pimblett</strong> showed remarkable resilience and began finding success with his jab in the third. He effectively landed combinations before circling away from danger, even stinging <strong>Gaethje</strong> with a big right hook late in the round, though the momentum was briefly interrupted by a <strong>Pimblett</strong> groin strike. The fourth round proved crucial as <strong>Gaethje</strong> badly hurt <strong>Pimblett</strong> with a left hook, sending him to the canvas. Despite eating additional right hooks and being sat down repeatedly, <strong>Pimblett</strong> somehow survived, tying up in the clinch against the cage before both fighters traded shots in the center until the round's conclusion.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The final round saw <strong>Pimblett</strong> throw caution to the wind, knowing he needed a finish. He launched everything at <strong>Gaethje</strong> from the opening seconds and attempted to secure takedowns, but the veteran's defense held firm. As exhaustion set in for both men, they found themselves tied up against the cage with neither able to establish clear dominance. <strong>Gaethje</strong> managed to land significant combinations in the final minute, though both fighters' fatigue was evident.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When the final bell sounded, <strong>Gaethje</strong> had clearly done enough to secure the victory, though the fight showcased the reckless fighting styles of both competitors. While their willingness to trade bombs created an entertaining spectacle, it raised serious questions about their ability to compete with the division's elite technical strikers like <strong>Arman Tsarukyan</strong> or champion <strong>Ilia Topuria</strong>. Looking ahead, <strong>Gaethje</strong> will likely face <strong>Topuria</strong> next in what could serve as a final chapter to his storied career. For <strong>Pimblett</strong>, a step back down the rankings appears necessary, with a potential matchup against the winner of <strong>BSD vs. Dan Hooker</strong> making sense to rebuild his momentum and refine his approach against elite competition.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="sean-o'malley-vs-yadong-song">
        <h3>Sean O'Malley vs. Yadong Song</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>This bantamweight showdown featured two fighters looking to solidify their positions in a crowded division. <strong>Sean O'Malley</strong>, the former bantamweight champion, entered the octagon seeking to rebound from his title loss to <strong>Merab Dvalishvili</strong> at UFC 306. Known for his flashy striking and promotional star power, <strong>O'Malley</strong> needed a statement victory to work his way back into title contention. Across from him stood <strong>Yadong Song</strong>, a durable Chinese fighter who had compiled an impressive 2-1 record in his last three outings. <strong>Song</strong> represented a legitimate test, with the power and wrestling ability to trouble even the division's best.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The opening round established the tactical framework for the entire contest. <strong>Song</strong> immediately looked to pressure <strong>O'Malley</strong>, closing distance aggressively while <strong>O'Malley</strong> utilized his superior movement to circle around the perimeter of the octagon. Whenever <strong>O'Malley</strong> attempted to engage at close range, <strong>Song</strong> responded by loading up on powerful haymakers, forcing the former champion to think twice about extended exchanges. <strong>O'Malley</strong> spent much of the round on his bicycle, avoiding engagement while <strong>Song</strong> tried to trap him against the cage. In the final seconds, <strong>Song's</strong> explosive entries paid dividends as he secured a takedown, immediately threatening a guillotine before advancing to mount position as the round expired.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The second round saw <strong>Song</strong> continue his aggressive approach, remaining explosive in his forward movement. After missing on a spinning backfist attempt, <strong>Song</strong> connected with a thunderous right hand that clearly troubled <strong>O'Malley</strong>. Sensing an opportunity, <strong>Song</strong> shot for a single leg, eventually tying <strong>O'Malley</strong> up against the cage and taking his back. From this dominant position, <strong>Song</strong> wore on his opponent with repeated knees to the thigh while <strong>O'Malley</strong> eschewed traditional wrist control defense in favor of throwing elbows. Though <strong>Song</strong> successfully completed the takedown and achieved mount once again, <strong>O'Malley</strong> managed to scramble back to his feet. By round's end, the damage was evident on <strong>O'Malley's</strong> legs—red marks and compromised movement told the story of <strong>Song's</strong> effective attack.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The final round proved decisive as both fighters traded heavy shots in the pocket. While both landed significant strikes, <strong>Song's</strong> face began showing the accumulated damage more prominently. When <strong>Song</strong> attempted another takedown, his fatigue became apparent as he lacked the energy to secure meaningful control. <strong>O'Malley</strong> capitalized on this exhaustion, landing a big right hand that visibly stunned <strong>Song</strong>. As the round entered its final moments, <strong>O'Malley</strong> opened up his arsenal and began systematically picking apart the tired Chinese fighter, landing clean combinations that left <strong>Song</strong> battered and bloodied.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When the judges' scorecards were read, <strong>O'Malley</strong> had done enough in the third round to secure the unanimous decision victory, though the fight itself failed to deliver the fireworks many expected. Both bantamweight contests on the evening proved somewhat lackluster, with the <strong>O'Malley-Song</strong> bout only marginally more entertaining than its counterpart. Looking ahead, the UFC will likely push <strong>O'Malley</strong> toward another title shot despite questions about whether he's earned it, banking on his star power and promotional value. For <strong>Song</strong>, this loss confirms his status as a gatekeeper unable to crack the division's upper echelon. A step down in competition appears necessary, with a potential matchup against <strong>Deiveson Figueiredo</strong> making sense as both fighters look to rebuild their momentum in the bantamweight rankings.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="waldo-cortes-acosta-vs-derrick-lewis">
        <h3>Waldo Cortes-Acosta vs. Derrick Lewis</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Ground and Pound at 3:14 Round 2 of 3, 8:14 Total</p>
        <p>The heavyweight division delivered a clash of styles as the rising <strong>Waldo Cortes-Acosta</strong> faced off against the legendary knockout artist <strong>Derrick Lewis</strong>. <strong>Cortes-Acosta</strong>, boasting an impressive 13-1 professional record and riding a three-fight winning streak in the UFC, represented the new generation of heavyweights looking to make their mark. His recent victories over <strong>Robelis Despaigne</strong>, <strong>Augusto Sakai</strong>, and <strong>Damien Grabowski</strong> had positioned him as a legitimate threat in the division. Standing across from him was the 40-year-old <strong>Lewis</strong>, the UFC's all-time heavyweight knockout leader with 15 finishes to his name. Coming off a devastating first-round knockout of <strong>Jhonata Diniz</strong> just two months prior in November 2025, <strong>"The Black Beast"</strong> was looking to prove he still belonged among the division's elite despite being on the wrong side of 40.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At the opening bell, <strong>Lewis</strong> wasted no time asserting his veteran presence, immediately putting <strong>Cortes-Acosta</strong> on the defensive with his trademark power punching. The younger fighter found himself backing up as <strong>Lewis</strong> stalked forward with bad intentions. However, as the round progressed, <strong>Cortes-Acosta</strong> began finding his rhythm on the feet, landing clean shots in the exchanges. When the action hit the canvas, <strong>Cortes-Acosta's</strong> grappling superiority became evident. From top position, he delivered heavy ground strikes while <strong>Lewis</strong> struggled from his back, unable to generate the explosive scrambles that had saved him in previous fights. <strong>Cortes-Acosta</strong> controlled the remainder of the round with his grappling, establishing a clear advantage in that phase of the fight.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The second round opened with both fighters trading leather on the feet, with <strong>Cortes-Acosta</strong> continuing to find success with his striking combinations. As the round wore on, <strong>Lewis</strong> began showing signs of fatigue—a concerning development that <strong>Cortes-Acosta</strong> quickly recognized and exploited. The younger fighter once again secured a takedown, and this time the result was more definitive. From top position, <strong>Cortes-Acosta</strong> unleashed a relentless barrage of ground and pound that <strong>Lewis</strong> simply could not defend. The legendary knockout artist, now clearly exhausted, offered minimal resistance as the strikes rained down, forcing referee intervention at 3:14 of the second round.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The stoppage was both timely and unfortunate, as it highlighted the harsh reality of aging in combat sports. <strong>Lewis</strong> appeared completely exhausted and unable to mount any meaningful defense, making the referee's decision an easy one. This marks a concerning trend for the beloved veteran, whose recent performances have shown diminishing returns. With <strong>Lewis</strong> likely contemplating retirement and a potential move to bare-knuckle boxing or professional wrestling to extend his earning potential, the heavyweight division may be saying goodbye to one of its most entertaining personalities. For <strong>Cortes-Acosta</strong>, this victory represents a significant step forward in his UFC journey. With four consecutive wins now under his belt, he finds himself on the doorstep of the heavyweight rankings. A matchup against someone in the 10-15 range makes perfect sense for his next outing, particularly after <strong>Josh Hokit</strong> called him out in his post-fight interview. The young Cuban has proven he belongs among the division's contenders and appears ready to test himself against ranked opposition.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="natália-silva-vs-rose-namajunas">
        <h3>Natália Silva vs. Rose Namajunas</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>This women's flyweight showdown pitted the surging Brazilian <strong>Natália Silva</strong> against former strawweight champion <strong>Rose Namajunas</strong> in a bout with significant title implications. <strong>Silva</strong> entered the octagon as one of the division's hottest prospects, riding an impressive seven-fight winning streak with her most recent victory coming via spectacular head kick knockout over <strong>Jessica Andrade</strong> at UFC 322. The 26-year-old Brazilian had established herself as a force to be reckoned with at 125 pounds, combining technical striking with finishing ability. Across from her stood <strong>Namajunas</strong>, a two-time former strawweight champion who had moved up to flyweight seeking new challenges. "Thug Rose" came into this contest on a two-fight winning streak in her new weight class, with victories over <strong>Amanda Ribas</strong> and <strong>Tracy Cortez</strong> positioning her as a legitimate title contender at flyweight.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At the opening bell, both fighters appeared tentative, feeling each other out with measured striking exchanges. <strong>Silva</strong> utilized her jab effectively to establish range while <strong>Namajunas</strong> looked for opportunities to counter. As the round progressed, <strong>Silva</strong> began implementing a body attack strategy that would prove crucial throughout the fight. Her kicks to the midsection found their mark repeatedly, while <strong>Namajunas</strong> struggled to find consistent offensive rhythm. When <strong>Silva</strong> attempted to press the action, <strong>Namajunas</strong> showed her championship pedigree by tying up in the clinch and securing a late takedown. However, <strong>Silva</strong> demonstrated excellent defensive grappling, immediately working back to her feet and avoiding any sustained ground control.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The second round saw <strong>Silva</strong> begin to assert her dominance more clearly. The Brazilian continued her body attack while mixing in effective head strikes, putting together combinations that troubled <strong>Namajunas</strong>. Though <strong>Namajunas</strong> managed to secure another takedown, once again <strong>Silva</strong> refused to let the former champion work from top position, scrambling back to her feet with relative ease. On the feet, <strong>Silva's</strong> volume and accuracy were becoming increasingly problematic for <strong>Namajunas</strong>, who seemed unable to solve the puzzle presented by the younger fighter's striking game.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Moving into the final round, <strong>Silva</strong> continued to pour on the pressure, landing clean combinations and body strikes while <strong>Namajunas</strong> offered little in return. The veteran former champion appeared to be fighting not to lose rather than fighting to win, a concerning tactical approach given that she almost certainly needed a finish at this point. <strong>Silva</strong> cruised through the round, landing at will and never appearing in serious danger, putting the exclamation point on a dominant three-round performance.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When the judges' scorecards were announced, <strong>Silva's</strong> unanimous decision victory came as no surprise to anyone watching. The fight, however, left much to be desired in terms of entertainment value. Both fighters seemed content to operate at a measured pace, resulting in a technically sound but largely uneventful contest that did little to excite the crowd. This bout exemplified the current state of the women's flyweight division—a weight class that appears to be struggling with a lack of compelling matchups and exciting fighters capable of capturing fan interest. Looking ahead, <strong>Silva</strong> has clearly earned her shot at the flyweight title. With this victory, she should be next in line to challenge for championship gold, finally getting the opportunity to prove herself against the division's best. For <strong>Namajunas</strong>, this loss raises questions about her future in the sport. At this stage of her career, continuing to compete may not make sense, particularly given the accumulation of damage over her long tenure in the UFC. A potential step away from competition to focus on coaching or other endeavors might be the wisest path forward for the beloved veteran.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="jean-silva-vs-arnold-allen">
        <h3>Jean Silva vs. Arnold Allen</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>This featherweight clash represented a critical juncture for both competitors, as Brazilian knockout artist <strong>Jean Silva</strong> looked to continue his meteoric rise while British veteran <strong>Arnold Allen</strong> sought to halt a troubling skid. <strong>Silva</strong> entered the octagon riding a wave of momentum with five consecutive victories inside the UFC, including spectacular first-round finishes in four of those wins. The 29-year-old Brazilian had become known for his explosive power and finishing instinct, establishing himself as one of the division's most dangerous strikers. Standing across from him was <strong>Allen</strong>, a seasoned featherweight contender whose recent form had been concerning. After compiling an impressive 9-1 record in his first ten UFC appearances, <strong>Allen</strong> had dropped three consecutive fights to elite competition in <strong>Max Holloway</strong>, <strong>Movsar Evloev</strong>, and <strong>Giga Chikadze</strong>. At 30 years old, this represented a must-win situation for the Englishman if he hoped to remain relevant in the crowded 145-pound landscape.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The opening bell revealed a tactical chess match as both fighters showed respect for each other's power. <strong>Allen</strong> utilized his technical striking to control range, landing clean jabs and maintaining disciplined footwork. <strong>Silva</strong>, known for his aggressive finishing style, appeared more measured than usual, perhaps cognizant of <strong>Allen's</strong> well-rounded skill set. Throughout the round, <strong>Allen</strong> established his jab as a consistent weapon while <strong>Silva</strong> looked for opportunities to land his trademark power shots. The Brazilian showed flashes of his finishing ability but couldn't find the opening he needed against the experienced veteran.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As the fight progressed into the second round, <strong>Allen</strong> continued to impose his technical game, working behind his jab and mixing in body attacks that began to accumulate on <strong>Silva</strong>. The British fighter's experience at the highest levels of the division became increasingly evident as he controlled distance and denied <strong>Silva</strong> the explosive exchanges that had led to his previous knockout victories. <strong>Silva</strong> showed moments of brilliance with powerful strikes, but <strong>Allen's</strong> defensive awareness and movement kept him out of serious danger.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The final round saw <strong>Allen</strong> assert his dominance more clearly, continuing to work his jab while mixing in combinations that troubled <strong>Silva</strong>. The Brazilian attempted to turn the tide with aggressive bursts of offense, but <strong>Allen's</strong> superior conditioning and technical precision allowed him to weather these storms and respond with clean counter-striking. As the final bell sounded, it was clear that <strong>Allen</strong> had done enough to secure the victory on the scorecards.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The judges confirmed what most observers recognized, awarding <strong>Allen</strong> a unanimous decision victory that snapped his three-fight losing streak. This win represents a crucial turning point for the British fighter, proving he can still compete at a high level against dangerous opponents. Looking ahead, <strong>Allen</strong> should face someone in the 10-15 ranking range to continue rebuilding his position in the division. For <strong>Silva</strong>, this loss serves as a valuable learning experience, exposing areas of his game that need development if he hopes to contend with the division's elite. The knockout artist will need to refine his technical striking and develop better strategies against more experienced opponents. A step back against unranked competition makes sense for his next outing, allowing him to work on these deficiencies while rebuilding momentum toward another run at the featherweight rankings.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="umar-nurmagomedov-vs-deiveson-figueiredo">
        <h3>Umar Nurmagomedov vs. Deiveson Figueiredo</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>This bantamweight showdown headlined the preliminary card, featuring undefeated prospect <strong>Umar Nurmagomedov</strong> against former flyweight champion <strong>Deiveson Figueiredo</strong> in a bout with major title implications. <strong>Nurmagomedov</strong>, carrying the weight of the legendary family name, entered the octagon with an unblemished 19-0 professional record. The 28-year-old Dagestani fighter had proven himself as one of the bantamweight division's most complete fighters, combining elite wrestling with improving striking to dominate his opposition. His most recent victory, a dominant performance against <strong>Cory Sandhagen</strong> at UFC 321, had positioned him as the clear number-one contender for the bantamweight title. Across the cage stood <strong>Figueiredo</strong>, the former flyweight kingpin who had made a successful transition to 135 pounds. With a 2-1 record at bantamweight and coming off a victory over <strong>Marlon Vera</strong> in his last outing, "Deus Da Guerra" represented a dangerous test with his knockout power and submission skills.</p>
        <br>
        <p>From the opening seconds, <strong>Nurmagomedov</strong> established his game plan with precision. The Dagestani fighter immediately looked to implement his wrestling, shooting for takedowns and controlling the pace of the fight. <strong>Figueiredo</strong> showed excellent defensive grappling early, stuffing several attempts and keeping the fight on the feet where his power could be a factor. However, as the round progressed, <strong>Nurmagomedov's</strong> relentless pressure began to wear on the Brazilian. Late in the round, <strong>Nurmagomedov</strong> secured a takedown and immediately transitioned to mount, landing ground strikes as <strong>Figueiredo</strong> worked desperately to escape the dominant position.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The second round saw <strong>Nurmagomedov</strong> continue his methodical assault. While <strong>Figueiredo</strong> showed improved takedown defense early, the constant threat of the wrestling allowed <strong>Nurmagomedov</strong> to land clean strikes on the feet. When <strong>Nurmagomedov</strong> did secure takedowns, he immediately advanced to dominant positions, showcasing the grappling excellence that has become synonymous with fighters from Dagestan. <strong>Figueiredo's</strong> submission threats from bottom position were neutralized by <strong>Nurmagomedov's</strong> positional awareness and control.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the final frame, <strong>Nurmagomedov</strong> put on a grappling clinic. He secured multiple takedowns at will, transitioning seamlessly between positions and denying <strong>Figueiredo</strong> any opportunity to mount offense. The Brazilian's fatigue became increasingly apparent as <strong>Nurmagomedov</strong> maintained relentless pressure, landing strikes from top position while draining his opponent's energy reserves. By the time the final bell sounded, there was no doubt about the outcome.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The judges' scorecards reflected <strong>Nurmagomedov's</strong> complete dominance, awarding him a unanimous decision victory that further cemented his status as the bantamweight division's top contender. This performance showcased <strong>Nurmagomedov's</strong> well-rounded skill set and ability to neutralize dangerous opponents with his systematic approach. Looking ahead, <strong>Nurmagomedov</strong> has unquestionably earned his title shot and should be next in line to challenge for the bantamweight championship. His combination of elite wrestling, improving striking, and tactical intelligence makes him a nightmare matchup for anyone in the division. For <strong>Figueiredo</strong>, this loss raises questions about his future at bantamweight. While he's had success at 135 pounds, the elite grapplers in the division appear to present matchup problems that his power and submissions can't overcome. A return to flyweight might be worth considering, where his skill set matches up more favorably against the competition.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="ateba-gautier-vs-andrey-pulyaev">
        <h3>Ateba Gautier vs. Andrey Pulyaev</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>Decision, Unanimous at 3 Rounds, 15:00 Total</p>
        <p>This middleweight matchup featured two prospects looking to establish themselves in the UFC's competitive 185-pound division. <strong>Ateba Gautier</strong>, the French-Cameroonian fighter, came into the bout with a 15-2 professional record and sporting a three-fight winning streak inside the octagon. His recent victories over <strong>Josh Fremd</strong>, <strong>Gerald Meerschaert</strong>, and <strong>Ikram Aliskerov</strong> had showcased his well-rounded skill set and ability to compete against established UFC veterans. At 29 years old, <strong>Gautier</strong> appeared poised to break into the middleweight rankings with another strong performance. His opponent, <strong>Andrey Pulyaev</strong>, brought an 18-2 record into the cage as he made his highly anticipated UFC debut. The 27-year-old Russian had earned his contract through an impressive showing on Dana White's Contender Series, displaying the kind of finishing ability that catches the promotion's attention. This represented a significant step up in competition for <strong>Pulyaev</strong>, testing whether his skills could translate against proven UFC-level opposition.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The fight opened with both middleweights feeling each other out, showing mutual respect while looking for openings. <strong>Gautier</strong> utilized his experience advantage to control the pace, working behind his jab and mixing in leg kicks to establish range. <strong>Pulyaev</strong> showed no signs of octagon jitters, responding with powerful strikes of his own and demonstrating the confidence that had earned him his UFC contract. As the round progressed, the action settled into a technical striking battle with neither fighter able to establish clear dominance, though <strong>Gautier's</strong> slightly higher output and cleaner combinations likely edged him ahead on the scorecards.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The middle frame saw both fighters increase their output, with longer exchanges in the pocket becoming more frequent. <strong>Gautier</strong> continued to work his jab effectively while <strong>Pulyaev</strong> looked to land his heavier strikes in counter opportunities. When the fight hit the mat, <strong>Gautier's</strong> grappling experience became evident as he controlled positions and prevented <strong>Pulyaev</strong> from mounting any sustained offense from bottom. The round was competitive but appeared to favor <strong>Gautier's</strong> more consistent volume and control.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the final round, both fighters appeared content to let the fight play out at a measured pace. While competitive striking exchanges occurred, neither man seemed willing to take the risks necessary to secure a definitive finish. <strong>Gautier</strong> maintained his technical approach, landing clean combinations while avoiding <strong>Pulyaev's</strong> power shots. As the final bell sounded, it was clear that while neither fighter had dominated, <strong>Gautier</strong> had likely done enough with his consistent output and control to secure the decision.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The judges confirmed this assessment, awarding <strong>Gautier</strong> a unanimous decision victory that extended his winning streak to four consecutive fights. While the bout lacked the explosive action that makes for memorable highlights, <strong>Gautier's</strong> performance demonstrated the kind of steady improvement and consistent execution that leads to long-term success in the UFC. Looking forward, <strong>Gautier</strong> should get a fight against someone in the 15-20 ranking range, testing himself against fringe contenders as he continues his climb up the middleweight ladder. For <strong>Pulyaev</strong>, this loss serves as a tough but valuable introduction to UFC competition. The Russian showed he belongs at this level and should bounce back against unranked opposition in his next outing, allowing him to build confidence and experience in the world's premier mixed martial arts organization.</p>

        <h3>Nikita Krylov vs. Modestas Bukauskas</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Overhand Right to Ground Strikes at 4:57 Round 3 of 3, 14:57 Total</p>
        <p>This light heavyweight clash pitted two fighters at critical junctures in their careers against one another. <strong>Nikita Krylov</strong>, the 33-year-old Ukrainian veteran, entered the octagon desperately needing a victory after suffering consecutive first-round knockout losses to <strong>Dominick Reyes</strong> and <strong>Bogdan Guskov</strong>. These devastating defeats had halted the momentum of a three-fight winning streak that had positioned <strong>Krylov</strong> on the cusp of title contention. For a fighter who had spent years as a fixture in the light heavyweight division, this represented a make-or-break moment to prove he could still compete at the highest level. His opponent, <strong>Modestas Bukauskas</strong>, brought a contrasting trajectory into the fight. The 31-year-old Lithuanian entered on a four-fight winning streak with a 19-6 overall record, establishing himself as one of the division's rising contenders. This bout represented the toughest test of <strong>Bukauskas's</strong> career, with a victory potentially earning him a shot at a ranked opponent and legitimizing his status as a light heavyweight threat.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The opening round set a concerning tone for what would become a largely forgettable contest. <strong>Bukauskas</strong> came out aggressively, stunning <strong>Krylov</strong> with a left hand that immediately put the Ukrainian on his back foot. <strong>Krylov</strong> responded by closing the distance and initiating a clinch against the cage, eventually dragging the fight to the mat. Once there, <strong>Bukauskas</strong> demonstrated solid defensive grappling, working back to his feet and re-engaging in the clinch. After separating, both fighters appeared tentative, with <strong>Krylov</strong> landing a clean strike late in the round. However, the overall output remained disappointingly low, with neither man willing to take significant risks.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The second round continued the lackluster pattern established in the opener. <strong>Krylov</strong> employed teep kicks in an attempt to maintain distance, but failed to connect with anything substantial. The fighters repeatedly found themselves tied up against the cage, exchanging positions without landing meaningful strikes. When they did separate and return to the center of the octagon, the striking output remained minimal. <strong>Bukauskas</strong> threw spinning backfists late in the round, but nothing significant landed, leaving fans increasingly frustrated with the lack of action.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The final round began much like the previous two, with both fighters circling and landing sporadic strikes that failed to generate any momentum. <strong>Bukauskas</strong> connected with a clean left hook that momentarily troubled <strong>Krylov</strong>, but the Ukrainian weathered the strike without serious issue. The fight devolved into a pattern of brief striking exchanges followed by extensive circling, with neither man willing to commit to sustained offense. Then, with just three seconds remaining in the contest, the fight exploded into life. <strong>Krylov</strong> landed a massive overhand right that sent <strong>Bukauskas</strong> crashing to the canvas. Sensing the finish, <strong>Krylov</strong> followed his opponent to the ground and unleashed a barrage of strikes that forced the referee to intervene at 4:57 of the third round.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The dramatic finish stood in stark contrast to the 14 minutes and 57 seconds that preceded it. While <strong>Krylov</strong> managed to snatch victory from the jaws of a likely decision loss, the overall quality of the fight raised serious questions about both competitors. For nearly the entire contest, both men appeared content to coast, showing little urgency or willingness to engage. The finish, while exciting, couldn't erase the memory of an overwhelmingly boring fight that did neither fighter any favors. Looking ahead, <strong>Krylov</strong> gets to extend his UFC career with this crucial victory, though his performance prior to the knockout suggests he's fighting on borrowed time. A matchup against someone outside the rankings makes sense as he looks to rebuild confidence. For <strong>Bukauskas</strong>, this devastating knockout loss derails his four-fight winning streak in heartbreaking fashion. Getting caught with three seconds left after what appeared to be a winning performance represents one of the cruelest outcomes in combat sports, and the Lithuanian will need time to recover both physically and mentally from this setback.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="alex-perez-vs-charles-johnson">
        <h3>Alex Perez vs. Charles Johnson</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Left Hook at 3:16 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>This flyweight showdown featured two veterans with everything on the line. <strong>Alex Perez</strong>, the 33-year-old flyweight contender, brought a 25-10 overall record into the octagon but arrived with significant baggage. Since making his UFC debut in 2017, injuries had plagued his career and limited his activity in the promotion. His recent 1-3 record over his last four fights included losses to elite competition like <strong>Asu Almabayev</strong>, <strong>Tatsuro Taira</strong>, and <strong>Muhammed Mokaev</strong>, raising questions about whether he could still compete with the division's best. Adding to his troubles, <strong>Perez</strong> had missed weight by 2.5 pounds, a concerning sign that suggested either poor preparation or difficulties managing his weight cut. For a fighter already on uncertain ground, this misstep only added to the pressure. Across from him stood <strong>Charles Johnson</strong>, a 35-year-old veteran making what many believed could be his final push for UFC gold. After a rocky 2-4 start to his UFC career following his 2022 debut, <strong>Johnson</strong> had found his groove, going 5-1 in his last six fights. Coming off a victory in his previous outing, <strong>Johnson</strong> saw this as an opportunity to break into title contention. With both fighters on the wrong side of 30, the stakes couldn't have been higher—win and continue the championship dream, or lose and face the very real possibility of career twilight.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The opening bell saw both fighters begin cautiously, with <strong>Johnson</strong> establishing his game plan early by throwing numerous body kicks to soften up <strong>Perez</strong>. Meanwhile, <strong>Perez</strong> remained patient, feinting frequently but refusing to commit to any significant combinations or power shots. The measured approach suggested a fighter looking to conserve energy while searching for the perfect opening. Then, in a flash, <strong>Perez</strong> found it. A devastating left hook connected flush on <strong>Johnson's</strong> chin, sending the veteran crashing to the canvas. <strong>Perez</strong> immediately recognized the opportunity, following <strong>Johnson</strong> to the ground and applying pressure with follow-up strikes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Displaying the heart and toughness that had carried him through a long career, <strong>Johnson</strong> somehow managed to return to his feet despite being clearly hurt. However, it became immediately apparent that he was operating on survival instinct alone. <strong>Perez</strong>, sensing blood in the water, became a predator stalking wounded prey. He pressed forward relentlessly, landing a knee to the head that further compromised <strong>Johnson's</strong> already-shaky equilibrium. The veteran flyweight continued backing up, unable to mount any meaningful offense as <strong>Perez</strong> hunted him around the octagon.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Johnson</strong> went down again, and <strong>Perez</strong> took his back, cracking him with another left hand that snapped his head violently. Through sheer determination, <strong>Johnson</strong> again fought back to his feet, but by this point, the outcome was inevitable. He was fighting on autopilot, his legs unsteady and his defenses compromised. <strong>Perez</strong> landed yet another crushing left hand, and <strong>Johnson</strong> dropped to the canvas for the final time. The referee had seen enough, stepping in to wave off the contest at 3:16 of the opening round.</p>
        <br>
        <p>From the moment that first left hook landed, <strong>Johnson</strong> was never truly in the fight. He was out on his feet, his incredible toughness the only thing keeping him conscious as <strong>Perez</strong> mercilessly hunted him down and landed bomb after bomb. While <strong>Johnson's</strong> warrior spirit was admirable, the beating he absorbed raised serious concerns about the long-term consequences. For <strong>Perez</strong>, this represented a crucial bounceback victory that keeps his flyweight aspirations alive. He should receive a matchup against someone in the top 10 next, giving him an opportunity to claw his way back toward the upper echelon of the division. However, he must address his weight-cutting issues—missing weight is unacceptable at this level and could cost him future opportunities. For <strong>Johnson</strong>, the path forward is murky at best. At 35 years old and coming off a brutal knockout loss, retirement might be the wisest option. The sport has given him many memories, but the accumulation of damage and the reality of age suggest it might be time to step away from competition before suffering further punishment.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="josh-hokit-vs-denzel-freeman">
        <h3>Josh Hokit vs. Denzel Freeman</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Retirement at 4:59 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>This heavyweight bout featured two of the division's most intriguing prospects in what promised to be a significant measuring stick fight. <strong>Josh Hokit</strong>, the former San Francisco 49er, had seamlessly transitioned from the gridiron to the octagon, compiling an impressive 7-0 professional record with all seven victories coming by finish. After earning his UFC contract through Dana White's Contender Series in August 2025, he wasted no time making an impact, securing a first-round finish over <strong>Max Gimenis</strong> in his November debut. Beyond his athletic prowess, <strong>Hokit</strong> brought a personality and charisma that the often-stale heavyweight division desperately needed—he was a fighter who understood how to promote himself and generate fan interest. Across from him stood <strong>Denzel Freeman</strong>, a 7-1 prospect who had also made his UFC debut in November with a unanimous decision victory over <strong>Marek Buljo</strong>. This matchup represented a true crossroads fight for both men, with the winner positioned to leap into the heavyweight rankings and the loser potentially facing questions about their future in the division.</p>
        <br>
        <p>From the opening bell, <strong>Hokit</strong> imposed his will with aggressive intent. He immediately closed the distance and secured a takedown, putting <strong>Freeman</strong> on his back where the former NFL player's athleticism became devastatingly apparent. <strong>Freeman</strong> attempted to scramble back to his feet, but <strong>Hokit</strong> demonstrated excellent positional awareness, taking his opponent's back. From this dominant position, <strong>Hokit</strong> landed a vicious knee to <strong>Freeman's</strong> thigh before transitioning to brutal ground and pound, striking the side of his opponent's head with punishing force.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Freeman</strong> managed to work back to his feet, but any hope of turning the tide evaporated as <strong>Hokit</strong> continued his relentless assault on the feet. Walking forward like a terminator, <strong>Hokit</strong> landed heavy strikes while <strong>Freeman</strong> could only cover up and absorb punishment. The onslaught sent <strong>Freeman</strong> to the canvas again, where he continued to turtle up without attempting to improve his position or mount any offense. <strong>Hokit</strong> followed him down, maintaining constant pressure and even delivering a humiliating spank to punctuate his dominance. Somehow, <strong>Freeman</strong> again fought back to his feet, but he was clearly a broken man.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Hokit</strong> landed more bombs on the feet, and <strong>Freeman</strong> desperately shot for a takedown in a last-ditch effort to survive. With less than a minute remaining in the round, <strong>Freeman</strong> looked completely gassed, his gas tank empty and his will shattered. In a moment that will be remembered for all the wrong reasons, <strong>Freeman</strong> began walking away from <strong>Hokit</strong> with seconds left in the round, effectively quitting on his stool. <strong>Hokit</strong>, understandably frustrated by his opponent's lack of engagement, flipped <strong>Freeman</strong> off in disgust. At this moment, referee <strong>Mark Smith</strong> made the controversial decision to stop the fight despite <strong>Freeman</strong> not being in immediate danger—he was simply exhausted and mentally defeated.</p>
        <br>
        <p>While <strong>Hokit</strong> looked impressive in dispatching his opponent, the stoppage itself was terrible and represents a black mark on <strong>Mark Smith's</strong> otherwise solid refereeing career. Fights should be stopped when a fighter is taking serious damage and cannot defend themselves or improve their position—not when the aggressor is throwing a temper tantrum and the opponent is simply exhausted. The correct call would have been to let the round end and allow <strong>Freeman's</strong> corner to decide whether to send him out for the second round. Despite the controversy, <strong>Hokit</strong> seized the moment in his post-fight interview, delivering a memorable limerick as he called out <strong>Waldo Cortes-Acosta</strong>—a bold move that showed his understanding of self-promotion, even if the matchup is unlikely to materialize immediately. Looking ahead, <strong>Hokit</strong> should get a fight against someone in the 15-20 range of the heavyweight rankings, continuing his rapid ascent through the division. For <strong>Freeman</strong>, this performance exposed fundamental deficiencies in his game. He showed virtually no striking ability and his wrestling was non-existent. Most concerningly, he appeared to quit mentally when the going got tough—a fatal flaw at the UFC level. <strong>Freeman</strong> needs to return to the drawing board, work on the glaring holes in his skill set, and develop the mental toughness required to compete at this level. Without significant improvements, his UFC tenure will likely be short-lived.</p>

      <div class="fight" id="ty-miller-vs-adam-fugitt">
        <h3>Ty Miller vs. Adam Fugitt</h3>
        <p class="fight-result"><strong>Result: </strong>KO/TKO, Right Hook and Knee (Standing TKO) at 4:59 Round 1 of 3</p>
        <p>The opening fight of UFC 324 showcased the welterweight debut of undefeated prospect <strong>Ty Miller</strong> against veteran <strong>Adam Fugitt</strong> in a bout that would set the tone for the Paramount era of UFC broadcasts. <strong>Miller</strong> entered the octagon carrying a perfect 6-0 professional record after earning his contract on Dana White's Contender Series in August 2025. The young prospect had generated considerable buzz with his well-rounded skill set, demonstrating the ability to finish fights in multiple ways. As a two-time Golden Gloves boxing champion, <strong>Miller's</strong> striking credentials were unquestionable, making his highly anticipated UFC debut one to watch. Standing across from him was <strong>Adam Fugitt</strong>, a battle-tested veteran sporting a 10-5 professional record and a 2-3 mark inside the UFC since his July 2022 debut. While his UFC record appeared lopsided, <strong>Fugitt's</strong> losses told a story of facing elite competition—he had fallen to the likes of <strong>Michael Morales</strong>, <strong>Mike Malott</strong>, and <strong>Islam Dulatov</strong>, all dangerous finishers. Coming off a devastating first-round knockout loss to <strong>Dulatov</strong> in July 2025, <strong>Fugitt</strong> desperately needed a victory to save his UFC career.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At the opening bell, <strong>Fugitt</strong> came out aggressively, attempting to establish his game plan by throwing teep kicks up the middle while applying constant forward pressure. The veteran was clearly looking to overwhelm the promotional newcomer and test his mettle early. In contrast, <strong>Miller</strong> appeared remarkably composed for a fighter making his UFC debut, picking his shots selectively and refusing to get drawn into a brawl. The young prospect's patience began paying dividends as he started landing with serious power on his right hand, the boxing pedigree evident in his technique and timing.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The turning point came when <strong>Miller</strong> connected with a stiff right hand that badly hurt <strong>Fugitt</strong>. The veteran, sensing he was in trouble, attempted to clinch and buy himself time to recover. However, <strong>Miller</strong> smelled blood and refused to let his opponent off the hook. He continued punishing <strong>Fugitt</strong> with nasty right hooks that visibly shook the veteran. <strong>Fugitt</strong> attempted a desperate spinning elbow that managed to open a cut on <strong>Miller's</strong> forehead, but this only seemed to energize the undefeated prospect. <strong>Miller</strong> then landed a massive right hand that dropped <strong>Fugitt</strong> to the canvas, immediately following him to the ground to finish the job. From top position, <strong>Miller</strong> unleashed ground and pound that nearly ended the fight.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Fugitt</strong> managed to scramble back to his feet, but this proved to be the beginning of the end. <strong>Miller</strong>, now fully confident and sensing victory, continued stalking his wounded opponent and landing powerful right hands at will. With just one second remaining in the opening round, <strong>Fugitt</strong> finally succumbed to the accumulation of damage, collapsing to the canvas and forcing the referee to call a halt to the contest at 4:59 of the first round.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The victory marked an impressive debut for <strong>Miller</strong> and served as an energetic start to the Paramount era of UFC broadcasts. However, questions remain about the young prospect's actual skill level and championship potential. <strong>Fugitt</strong> represents the type of opponent who could easily be cut from the UFC roster following this performance, and the fight provided no information about <strong>Miller's</strong> grappling ability—a critical component for success at the highest levels of the welterweight division. While his boxing looked polished and his finishing instinct was evident, much remains unknown about his overall game. Moving forward, the UFC will need to test <strong>Miller</strong> against progressively tougher opposition to determine whether he can compete with the elite at 170 pounds. For now, he's an intriguing prospect with obvious talent, but several more fights will be necessary before any definitive conclusions can be drawn about his ceiling in the sport. As for <strong>Fugitt</strong>, his UFC future appears bleak, and this loss may well mark the end of his tenure with the promotion.</p>
