      <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
      <p>This weekend, the UFC makes its return after a six-week hiatus for its first card of the year and the first card of the Paramount era, with UFC 324. The card is headlined by <strong>Justin Gaethje</strong> vs <strong>Paddy Pimblett</strong> for the UFC Interim Lightweight Championship at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The co-main event was originally supposed to be <strong>Kayla Harrison</strong> vs <strong>Amanda Nunes</strong> for the Undisputed UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship. However, due to a last-minute neck injury, Harrison needed to pull out of the matchup and it was postponed to a later date. Now, in the co-main event, <strong>Sean O'Malley</strong> will be facing <strong>Song Yadong</strong> in a high-profile matchup in the men's bantamweight division.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The rest of the main card contains matchups between rising heavyweight superstar <strong>Waldo Cortes-Acosta</strong> and fan-favorite <strong>Derrick Lewis</strong>, a fight with title contender implications in the women's flyweight division between <strong>Natalia Silva</strong> and <strong>Rose Namajunas</strong>, and lastly a bout between top featherweight contenders <strong>Arnold Allen</strong> and <strong>Jean Silva</strong>.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The prelims have some additional notable matchups between <strong>Umar Nurmagomedov</strong> and <strong>Deiveson Figueiredo</strong>, <strong>Ateba Gautier</strong> and <strong>Andrey Pulyaev</strong>, and <strong>Josh Hokit</strong> and <strong>Denzel Freeman</strong>.</p>

      <h3 id="lightweight-picture">Lightweight Title Picture</h3>
      <p>There's a lot of action going on in the lightweight division at the moment. For one, <strong>Ilia Topuria</strong> is currently taking an extended leave of absence from MMA as he deals with some personal matters, which has opened an opportunity for an interim title fight. On top of this, the rightful number one contender, <strong>Arman Tsarukyan</strong>, is nowhere to be seen in this main event—which has left a bit of confusion and distaste among hardcore MMA fans. Even after the bout this weekend, it doesn't look like things are going to get any better for the number one contender, as Dana has said that the winner of the championship bout this Saturday will be next in line for Topuria when he returns to competition sometime later this year.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As far as the main event goes, <strong>Pimblett</strong> comes into the title fight as a -230 favorite over <strong>Gaethje</strong>. Overall, Paddy boasts a 23-3 record, riding a 7-0 streak since his debut in the UFC in September 2022. Needless to say, Paddy's rise to the top of the lightweight division has been shrouded in controversy, with many fans saying that he has been the beneficiary of "Dana White privilege" and has been fast-tracked to the title. Although a seven-fight win streak in the UFC is extremely impressive, I would be remiss not to say that I agree with the "haters." To date, Paddy's biggest win came over the corpse of "Iron" Michael Chandler at the beginning of 2025, and besides that, the results have been nothing to write home about. Prior to this, Paddy garnered wins over Bobby "King" Green, Tony Ferguson, and an extremely controversial unanimous decision over Jared Gordon, which many still argue Paddy rightfully lost that night. All in all, it is shocking that Paddy is currently in the title picture.</p>
      <br>
      <p>On the other hand, <strong>Justin Gaethje</strong> has been a UFC staple for being one of, if not the most, entertaining fighters within the promotion. Boasting 14 performance bonuses to his name, Gaethje has been rightfully keyed as "must-see TV." Gaethje has been a mainstay at the top of the UFC lightweight division for the better part of a decade. Coming into this fight, Gaethje is 1-3 in his last four. His three wins came over Rafael Fiziev (two wins over the Azerbaijani) and a career-defining knockout over Dustin Poirier. Unfortunately, in the middle of his final run, Gaethje suffered a very one-sided knockout loss to Max Holloway at UFC 300. Given the loss, it is also quite controversial that he is fighting for UFC gold off of one win.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Once we get over the fact that both contenders probably shouldn't be fighting for the title, let's take a look at the betting line. It seems crazy to me that <strong>Paddy Pimblett</strong> is considered the favorite going into this fight, especially such a massive one. What has Paddy done for people to believe that he has the tools to get it done this weekend? Paddy couldn't finish Tony Ferguson, but Gaethje gave him irreparable brain damage. Paddy TKO'd a washed-up Michael Chandler, while Gaethje sent Dustin Poirier to the shadow realm. Gaethje has also been in the octagon against legends such as Khabib Nurmagomedov and Charles Oliveira. But don't worry, Paddy has gone toe-to-toe with the great Jared Gordon!</p>
      <br>
      <p>There is also the thought that Paddy will out-grapple Gaethje. Maybe there is some truth to that. However, where was Paddy's wrestling prowess against both Chandler and Ferguson? Sure, he submitted Green after Green unwisely lunged in and gave the jiu-jitsu specialist his neck. Regardless, I am not sold on the fact that Paddy is a grappling phenom.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I don't know what is going to happen in the championship fight, but something tells me that there is better value on Gaethje. Nevertheless, the real loser this weekend is <strong>Tsarukyan</strong>, as he continues to sit on the sidelines watching his prime pass him by.</p>

      <h3 id="bantamweight-picture">Bantamweight Title Picture</h3>
      <p>Up until December of last year, it was the Dvalishvili show in the bantamweight division, as no one could knock off the Georgian superstar as he started to lap the division. Fortunately for nearly every single contender at bantamweight, <strong>Petr Yan</strong> was able to get past Merab at UFC 323 and start his second run as a UFC champion.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Given Merab's dominance over the past five years, he is definitely entitled to an immediate rematch. However, now the door is open for who comes after that. I am certain that one of the two winners of the fights between <strong>Sean O'Malley</strong> vs <strong>Song Yadong</strong> and <strong>Umar Nurmagomedov</strong> vs <strong>Deiveson Figueiredo</strong> will get the next shot.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>O'Malley</strong> is the UFC's little darling and has been given opportunity after opportunity to become champion. They shot him up the rankings to fight Petr Yan for a number one contender bout. Then they gave him Sterling on short notice to fight for the belt. Then most recently, they gave him an immediate rematch against Merab after being thoroughly dominated in their first fight. This is the UFC's guy. If O'Malley wins this weekend in emphatic fashion, there is no doubt in my mind that he will be fighting for a belt later this year.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In the other bantamweight contender fight, <strong>Umar Nurmagomedov</strong> is taking on <strong>Deiveson Figueiredo</strong>. Although not as privileged as O'Malley, Umar has been the beneficiary of a lot of UFC goodwill during his time in the promotion—starting with an unwarranted number one contender bout against Cory Sandhagen, and then an immediate title shot. Still, Umar must definitely be feeling some pressure this weekend. Being put as the featured bout on the prelims shouldn't sit well with him, given that O'Malley is the co-main event. Umar needs to put on a show this weekend and make sure that people remember—whether it is a stone-cold knockout or a submission, this fight can't go to a decision. If the fight goes the distance, he will without a doubt have to fight again, most likely against the loser of the Yan vs Dvalishvili trilogy, which will not be an easy fight.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I hate to say it, but I don't think that either <strong>Song</strong> or <strong>Figueiredo</strong> has any chance of winning this weekend. The UFC did this matchmaking on purpose. They are behind both Sean and Umar and don't want to kill off one of their "golden boys." For example, Sean O'Malley is currently talking about retiring in the near future. A loss this weekend would put him on a three-fight losing streak and most definitely close the door on his career. So, a more favorable matchup against Song Yadong could be a matchup to rejuvenate the superstar's career and put him back on track toward the title.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Both fights should be competitive and entertaining, and with much on the line, should be some of, if not the best fights at the event.</p>

      <h3 id="bolo">BOLO: Rising Stars</h3>
      <p>There are two fighters flying below the radar this weekend who should be on everyone's watch list. <strong>Ateba Gautier</strong> and <strong>Josh Hokit</strong> are stars in the making and will look to build upon their undefeated UFC records this weekend.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Gautier</strong> is an absolute killer out of Cameroon, boasting a 9-1 record overall. Since making his debut in the UFC back in early 2025, Gautier has gone 3-0, decimating everyone that the promotion has put in front of him—starching each of his opponents by first-round knockout. This weekend, Gautier goes up against <strong>Andrey Pulyaev</strong> and is an -800 favorite against the Russian. If Gautier is to get past this next test this weekend, it will be time for him to face some stiffer competition up the rankings so that we can get a better sense of the middleweight's potential in the UFC.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Hokit</strong> is a heavyweight on the rise, and his bout this weekend is definitely flying under the radar. The former San Francisco 49er made his debut this past November at the now Meta Apex with a statement first-round finish against Max Genis. Hokit presents himself as an athletic heavyweight who could quickly move up the rankings, as the division desperately needs contenders. Besides the fact that he can throw down in the octagon, he also has a persona that makes people remember him. Inspired by Chael Sonnen, Hokit is not afraid to speak his mind and cut powerful promos on the mic. Whether you love or hate him, you'll remember, and Hokit hopes to make a statement this weekend and move on to 8-0 in his pro MMA career.</p>

      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
      <p>UFC 324 offers compelling narratives across the card as the promotion kicks off the Paramount era. The lightweight division takes center stage with a controversial interim title fight between <strong>Justin Gaethje</strong> and <strong>Paddy Pimblett</strong>, while the rightful number one contender, <strong>Arman Tsarukyan</strong>, watches from the sidelines. Meanwhile, the bantamweight division continues to sort itself out in the wake of <strong>Petr Yan's</strong> recent championship victory, with both <strong>Sean O'Malley</strong> and <strong>Umar Nurmagomedov</strong> looking to position themselves for the next title shot.</p>
      <br>
      <p>From rising prospects like <strong>Ateba Gautier</strong> and <strong>Josh Hokit</strong> to established stars fighting for their place in divisional hierarchies, this card promises to deliver drama, action, and potential division-altering outcomes. It will be interesting to see if Paramount has any additional tricks up their sleeves to make the event a little more special as they usher in a new era for the UFC.</p>
