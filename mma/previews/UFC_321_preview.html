      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This Saturday, October 25, 2025, the UFC returns to the Etihad Arena on "Fight Island" in Abu Dhabi for the highly anticipated <strong>UFC 321</strong>. The card is headlined by the recently minted UFC Heavyweight champion, <strong>Tom Aspinall</strong>, looking to defend his title against French superstar <strong>Ciryl "Bon Gamin" Gane</strong>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Aspinall enters this fight in phenomenal form. If you ignore his hiccup loss to Curtis Blaydes at UFC London in 2022, he is undefeated since his UFC debut, boasts a 100% finish rate, and has only seen the second round once. Gane has also seen considerable success in the UFC, with his losses coming only to top contenders. He now looks to finish his story by becoming the first French-born UFC Undisputed World Champion.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The co-main event features a clash between two top women's strawweights, <strong>Mackenzie Dern</strong> and <strong>Virna Jandiroba</strong>, for the vacant strawweight title. With Zhang Weili moving up to flyweight to challenge Valentina Shevchenko, both women have been given a prime opportunity to be crowned the new queen of the division.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Other notable main card fights include <strong>Umar Nurmagomedov vs. Mario Bautista</strong>, a bout with serious bantamweight title implications. Prior to that, <strong>Alexander Volkov vs. Jailton Almeida</strong> serves as a pivotal heavyweight matchup, with the winner likely next in line for a title shot. The main card opens with <strong>Aleksandar Rakic versus the undefeated Azamat Murzakanov</strong>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        On the prelims, the most notable fight is between <strong>Ikram Aliskerov and Park Jun-young</strong>. Aliskerov will look to increase his win streak to two and erase the memory of his first-round KO loss to Robert Whittaker last June.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Needless to say, UFC 321 is shaping up to be a memorable event!
      </p>

      <h3 id="heavyweights">State of the Heavyweights</h3>
      <p>
        The UFC heavyweight division has been at the center of MMA's biggest news this year, dominated by the prolonged anticipation for a Jon Jones vs. Tom Aspinall title unification bout. After stringing along the MMA community for nearly eight months, Jon Jones finally vacated the heavyweight title in June, allowing Tom Aspinall to be promoted to Undisputed Champion.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <strong>Tom Aspinall doesn't just need to win this weekend; he needs to do so in spectacular fashion.</strong> The UFC heavyweight division has been in a state of turmoil for nearly four years. It began with the UFC's failure to book a super-fight between then-champion Francis Ngannou and Jon Jones. After Ngannou vacated, the promotion again failed to make compelling matchups for Jones, ultimately losing a second champion without a defeat inside the octagon.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        With the last two champions leaving the promotion without losing, the legitimacy of the heavyweight title is in question. Is the UFC heavyweight champion truly "the baddest man on the planet?" Consider this: both Ngannou and Jones beat Ciryl Gane in title fights, with Jones submitting the Frenchman in just two minutes. If Gane wins this weekend, it would declare the heavyweight division a sham, suggesting the best fighters are no longer in the UFC and vindicating Jones's stance that Aspinall was never a worthy opponent for the sport's GOAT.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Even if you are a Jon Jones fan, you should be rooting for Aspinall this weekend. I certainly will be, and the UFC will surely be sweating during this main event. The stakes for the legitimacy of heavyweight MMA have never been higher.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Earlier on the card, the bout between <strong>Alexander Volkov and Jailton Almeida</strong> is the unspoken number-one contender fight. Almeida has found success since joining the UFC, going 8-1 in his first nine fights and showcasing high-level grappling. However, his one loss to Curtis Blaydes is concerning, as Blaydes was easily handled by Aspinall last June. Volkov, meanwhile, lost a controversial split decision to Gane last December and was submitted by Aspinall back in 2022. I hate to say it, but neither fighter seems to have a realistic chance of truly competing for the title, but it remains a pivotal fight to watch.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3 id="strawweights">Are the Strawweights Legit?</h3>
      <p>
        As mentioned, dominant champion Zhang Weili vacated her title, opening the door for Mackenzie Dern and Virna Jandiroba. In my view, Jandiroba has earned her shot, riding a five-fight win streak. Dern, at 2-2 in her last four, is less deserving. The UFC's promotional focus on Dern makes its preference clear.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        My issue with this fight is that it makes you question the legitimacy of women's MMA. I won't spell out why the UFC is pushing Dern—you can see for yourself—but it's pathetic. This kind of matchmaking undermines women's MMA as a real sport. I'd go so far as to say that women's MMA journalism isn't entirely legitimate either. It's a disgrace that "reporters" like Nina Drama, Helen Yee, and Minty Bets are considered premier "journalists" in the UFC. It's a joke that makes you question the legitimacy of other institutions.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Needless to say, I have little interest in this fight, and I don't care who wins. Zhang Weili was a great fighter and champion, but this co-main event is a significant downgrade.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3 id="storylines">Other Relevant Storylines</h3>
      <p>
        The other major storyline at UFC 321 is the potential number-one contender fight between <strong>Umar Nurmagomedov and Mario Bautista</strong>. With Merab Dvalishvili running through the bantamweight division as champion, viable contenders are becoming scarce. If Merab beats Petr Yan at UFC 323 in December, it's unclear what comes next for him.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Bautista enters this fight on an eight-fight win streak, with notable wins over Jose Aldo and Patchy Mix. A victory here would make him undeniable for a title shot, both on his own merit and due to the lack of other contenders.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Conversely, Umar is coming off a title-fight loss to Dvalishvili back in January. There has been trash talk between the champion and Umar regarding whether a win over Bautista warrants an immediate rematch. Umar believes he is deserving, citing his belief that he won their first fight, while Merab contends he needs another win. Regardless of who wins, I believe a two-fight win streak should be the absolute minimum for a title shot (barring extenuating circumstances).
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        No matter the result, both men are game and will look to maintain their relevancy in the crowded UFC bantamweight title picture.
