      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This weekend the UFC returns to its home at the freshly minted Meta Apex Arena in Las Vegas for its first Fight Night of 2026 on the Paramount broadcast deal. The card is headlined by Mario Bautista and Vinicius Oliveira in what promises to be a compelling bantamweight clash. Bautista, once riding an 8-fight win streak, saw that momentum halted by Umar Nurmagomedov last October and now looks to rebuild. Across from him stands Oliveira, a surging contender on a 6-fight tear who sees this as his opportunity to crack the top 10 and announce himself as a legitimate title threat.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main card also features the return of flyweight legend Kyoji Horiguchi, who faces Amir Albazi in what could be a title eliminator. Horiguchi spent a decade dominating in Bellator and RIZIN, capturing championships in both organizations, and his second UFC stint has potential title shot implications written all over it. Further down the card, heavyweight Jailton Almeida steps in on short notice to face Rizvan Kuniev, with both fighters desperate to bounce back from losses. On the prelims, keep an eye on Cong Wang versus Eduarda Moura in the women's flyweight division, as well as the Basharat brothers—Javid and Farid—both competing on the same card.

        <h3>Mario Bautista (#7) vs. Vinicius Oliveira (#18)</h3>
        
        <div class="fight-overview">
          <p>
            The main event features a fascinating stylistic clash between two bantamweights heading in opposite directions. Mario Bautista was riding high on an 8-fight win streak before running into the buzzsaw that is Umar Nurmagomedov last October. Along the way, he picked up a controversial split decision over the legendary Jose Aldo—a fight that drew boos from fans who weren't thrilled with his wrestling-heavy gameplan that kept Aldo pinned against the fence. Despite the criticism of his "boring" style, Bautista has quietly proven himself as an underrated silent killer from Arizona's MMA Lab, scoring wins over former Bellator champion Patchy Mix and weathering storms against elite competition. This marks his first UFC main event and first 5-round fight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Standing across from him is Vinicius "Lok Dog" Oliveira, the antithesis of everything Bautista represents. Oliveira is an entertainer—a hands-down, swing-heavy pressure fighter who's collected two Fight of the Night bonuses and one Performance of the Night award while riding a 6-fight win streak. The UFC clearly sees star potential in the Brazilian, and Oliveira himself has been vocal about believing the promotion wants him to "put Bautista out." It's not all roses though—Oliveira's weight cuts have been brutal, ballooning up to 183 pounds just three months before fights at 136. He's already planning a move to featherweight after capturing bantamweight gold, assuming he can get there first.
          </p>
        </div>

          <div class="reasoning">
            <p>
              This feels like a case of levels. Bautista has faced a murderer's row recently—Aldo, Mix, Nurmagomedov—and even in defeat showed he belongs at the top of the division. He overloaded Mix with volume in their fight, preventing the Bellator champ from ever getting comfortable, and he managed to survive Nurmagomedov's wrestling onslaught, which is no small feat. Oliveira, for all his entertaining qualities, has been a bit of a can crusher since joining the UFC. He's exciting against mid-tier competition, but this is a massive step up. Bautista is a seasoned veteran who won't be fazed by theatrics or pressure. I expect him to implement a methodical gameplan, likely using his wrestling to neutralize Oliveira's striking and grind out a decision victory. It might not be pretty, but Bautista gets it done.

        <h3>Amir Albazi (#9) vs. Kyoji Horiguchi (#12)</h3>
        
        <div class="fight-overview">
          <p>
            The co-main event brings us a flyweight clash loaded with title implications. Amir Albazi's 6-fight UFC win streak came to a crashing halt last November when Brandon Moreno pieced him up over five rounds. The loss was particularly frustrating for Albazi, an Iraqi fighter training out of Sweden who aspires to become the first Arab UFC champion. He's convinced he underperformed against Moreno and never showed "the real Amir Albazi," but injuries have plagued his career—he hasn't fought in 15 months and has undergone both neck and heart surgery. Medical complications forced him to withdraw from a bout against Tatsuro Taira last August, raising questions about whether he can stay healthy enough to make a title run.
          </p>
          <p>
            Across the cage stands Kyoji Horiguchi, a former UFC title challenger who spent the last decade dominating outside the promotion. During his absence, he captured championships in both Bellator and RIZIN, becoming a two-division champion in the latter organization. At 35 years old, Horiguchi looked sharp and explosive in his UFC return last November, submitting Tagir Ulanbekov and reminding everyone why he's considered one of the sport's elite flyweights. Many felt that performance alone warranted a title shot against Alexandre Pantoja, especially given their training relationship and the super fight narrative that matchup would create. With Pantoja now looking to reclaim his belt after a controversial loss to Joshua Van, Horiguchi knows a decisive win here keeps his title shot dreams alive.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="pick">
          <h4>Pick: </h4>
          <div class="method">

          </div>
          <div class="reasoning">
            <p>
              Horiguchi looked phenomenal against Ulanbekov, displaying the relentless pressure and indefatigable gas tank that made him a champion in multiple organizations. Meanwhile, Albazi is coming off a brutal five-round beating from Moreno, and his controversial win over Kai Kara-France—which most fans scored for KKF—doesn't inspire confidence. Add in the fact that Albazi can't seem to stay healthy or active, and the picture becomes even murkier. I don't think he's as good as his ranking suggests. Horiguchi, on the other hand, appears motivated and shows no signs of slowing down despite his age. His karate-based striking, incredible speed, and movement should give Albazi problems, and I expect the veteran to control the pace and cruise to a decision victory.

        <h3>Jailton Almeida (#3) vs. Rizvan Kuniev (#17)</h3>
        
        <div class="fight-overview">
          <p>
            Short-notice chaos hits the heavyweight division as Jailton "Malhadinho" Almeida steps in with just three weeks' notice after Ryan Spann withdrew. Almeida is coming off what many consider a robbery—a controversial split decision loss to Alexander Volkov at UFC 321 last October. Before that, he'd beaten Serghei Spivac by TKO and holds the UFC heavyweight record for ground control time with an absurd 21 minutes and 10 seconds against Derrick Lewis. That Lewis fight, however, exemplifies everything frustrating about Almeida's style. He controls opponents with his grappling but often fails to inflict meaningful damage, leading to fan criticism about his "boring" approach. His lone knockout loss came against Curtis Blaydes back in March 2024, ending a 15-fight win streak and exposing potential vulnerabilities when facing grapplers who can stuff his takedowns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rizvan Kuniev presents an interesting puzzle. This matchup doesn't make much sense on paper—the Dagestani fighter is getting a significant ranking jump despite losing to a ranked opponent in his UFC debut. His past also raises eyebrows; Kuniev was banned by the Nevada State Athletic Commission while in the PFL for testing positive for a cocktail of anabolic steroids including metenolone, drostanolone, 19-norandrosterone, and boldenone. The UFC's decision to sign him and immediately boost him up the rankings feels like either an example of "Dagestani privilege" or a desperate attempt to inject life into a stagnant heavyweight division. Either way, Kuniev trains with some of the world's best grapplers and has shown competence on the mats, including a win over Renan Ferreira that was later overturned to a no contest.
          </p>
        </div>

          <div class="reasoning">
            <p>
              This is a bold pick, but hear me out. Kuniev trains in Dagestan, which means he's been in the room with world-class grapplers his entire career. While I don't think he's the best grappler in the heavyweight division, he knows what he's doing on the mats. That Ferreira fight, despite being overturned, was grappling-heavy and showed Kuniev can hang with strong wrestlers. Almeida has struggled against anyone with legitimate grappling credentials because his entire gameplan relies on either submitting you or stalling you out for a decision. He can't inflict real damage. I see this fight playing out with Almeida desperately shooting for takedowns, Kuniev defending them and making Almeida work, and eventually the Brazilian gasses out. When Almeida comes in tired for yet another takedown attempt, Kuniev catches him and gets the finish. It's a risky call, but the value is there.

        <h3>Michał Oleksiejczuk (#33) vs. Marc-André Barriault (#44)</h3>
        
        <div class="fight-overview">
          <p>
            This middleweight clash features two fighters on the brink, though they're approaching that edge from different directions. Michał Oleksiejczuk was staring at his UFC pink slip after dropping three straight fights in 2024. Desperate times called for desperate measures, so he packed his bags and headed to Brazil to train with the Fighting Nerds. The move appears to have sparked a career renaissance—he's now riding a two-fight win streak and enters this bout as a massive -500 favorite. For Oleksiejczuk, this is about proving the turnaround is real and not just a temporary reprieve from the chopping block.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marc-André Barriault, meanwhile, is hanging on by a thread. The Canadian journeyman snapped a brutal three-fight losing streak—which included getting viciously knocked out by Joe "Bodybagz" Pyfer—with a win over Bruno Silva last May. But he immediately reverted to form, losing to Shara Magomedov in his next outing. At this point, the UFC seems to be using Barriault as a gatekeeper with no realistic path to title contention. Another loss this weekend might render him "unusable" by the promotion, as it would seriously call into question what a win over him actually means for an opponent's résumé.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="pick">

          </div>
          <div class="reasoning">
            <p>
              The trajectory here is pretty clear. Oleksiejczuk is in the middle of a genuine career resurgence, showing renewed energy and purpose since joining the Fighting Nerds. Barriault's best days are firmly in the rearview mirror. I think Oleksiejczuk gets him out of there, and afterward we'll all be left wondering whether Barriault even deserves to be in the UFC anymore. This should be a showcase finish for the Polish fighter.

        <h3>Jean Matsumoto (#28) vs. Farid Basharat (#30)</h3>
        
        <div class="fight-overview">
          <p>
            This bantamweight bout pits a rising Brazilian prospect against an undefeated finisher. Jean Matsumoto burst onto the scene at UFC Seattle last February, taking a short-notice fight against Rob Font and putting on such an entertaining performance that his stock rose despite the decision loss. He bounced back to finish the year strong, beating Miles Johns to improve to 3-1 in the UFC. At 17-1 overall, Matsumoto brings excitement every time he steps in the octagon, though questions remain about whether he has the well-rounded skillset to crack the top 15.
          </p>
          <p>
            Farid "Ferocious" Basharat enters this fight with an unblemished 14-0 record and the added motivation of fighting on the same card as his brother Javid. Despite being ranked lower than Matsumoto, he's installed as a heavy -320 favorite, largely due to the quality of his competition. His resume includes impressive victories over D'amon Blackshear and Chris Gutierrez, both of whom represent a significant step up from most of Matsumoto's opposition. For Basharat, this is about maintaining perfection and continuing his march toward title contention.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="pick">
          <h4>Pick: </h4>
          <div class="method">
            <strong>Method:</strong>
          </div>
          <div class="reasoning">
            <p>
              Matsumoto is undeniably fun to watch, but I don't see him as a serious threat here. He's not particularly dangerous on the ground, and while his striking is entertaining, it's not going to trouble a technical fighter like Basharat. His split decision win over Miles Johns was razor-close, and the level of competition Basharat has beaten—Blackshear and Gutierrez specifically—is considerably higher. I expect Basharat to use his superior grappling and technical striking to control this fight from start to finish, picking up a comfortable decision victory.

        <h3>Dustin Jacoby (#14) vs. Julius Walker (#26)</h3>
        
        <div class="fight-overview">
          <p>
            The light heavyweight division serves up a classic veteran-versus-prospect matchup. Dustin "The Hanyak" Jacoby burst out of the gates in his UFC run, going 6-0-1 to start, but the last couple of years have been unkind. The 37-year-old has struggled against the division's elite, dropping fights to Dominik Reyes, Khalil Rountree, and Azamat Murzakanov. Now riding a two-fight win streak against lesser competition, Jacoby knows this might be his last realistic shot at making a run toward UFC gold. Time is running out, and he needs to start stacking wins against ranked opponents to have any chance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Julius "Juice Box" Walker represents the future of the division. At just 26 years old, the rising prospect has plenty of time to develop, though his debut didn't go as planned—he lost to Alonzo Menifield, who himself just got knocked out by Volkan Oezdemir in November. Walker bounced back nicely though, closing out 2025 with a win over Rafael Cerqueira. A victory over the veteran Jacoby would constitute the first legitimate name on his résumé and signal his readiness for tougher competition. The 11-year age gap and experience differential make this a fascinating style clash.
          </p>

          <div class="reasoning">
            <p>
              Experience should win out here. Jacoby has faced significantly better competition throughout his career, and while he's been on the wrong end of some close decisions, he knows how to win fights at this level. Walker is raw and inexperienced, lacking any signature wins on his resume. That loss to Menifield looks even worse in hindsight given how Menifield got starched by Oezdemir shortly after. I think this is too big a jump too soon for Walker. Jacoby's veteran savvy should allow him to navigate any dangerous moments and hold on for a decision win, keeping his fading title hopes alive for at least one more fight.

        <h3>Alex Morono (#52) vs. Daniil Donchenko (#68)</h3>
        
        <div class="fight-overview">
          <p>
            This welterweight matchup is as lopsided as they come on paper. Alex "The Great White" Morono is fighting for his UFC life, riding a three-fight losing streak at 35 years old. The veteran has seen better days, and at +490, the bookmakers don't give him much chance of turning things around here. For Morono, this is likely his last opportunity to prove he belongs in the octagon. Another loss and the UFC will almost certainly cut ties with the longtime fighter.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other side stands Daniil Donchenko, the 24-year-old Ukrainian who won The Ultimate Fighter season 33 and immediately caught the UFC's attention as a potential star. Installed as a massive -700 favorite, Donchenko brings an exciting, finish-hunting style that the promotion loves. This matchup reeks of the UFC feeding Morono to their prospect, banking on Donchenko to deliver a highlight-reel finish and continue building momentum. It's classic matchmaking for a fighter they want to fast-track.

            <p>
              This one's pretty straightforward. Morono is on a three-fight skid and wasn't particularly good even before the losing streak. Donchenko has all the momentum, youth, and most importantly, the full backing of the UFC promotional machine. I expect the Ukrainian to make a statement here, getting Morono out of there and continuing his march through the welterweight division.

        <div class="fight-overview">
          <p>
            When the UFC matchmakers want guaranteed violence, they book fighters like these two. Nikolay Veretennikov, a 13-7 Kazakh fighter, comes in as a moderate -300 favorite despite showing very little since joining the promotion. His UFC tenure has been rough—he's gone just 1-3 since his 2024 debut, with his lone win being a split decision over Francisco Prado, who himself is drowning on a three-fight losing streak. Not exactly an impressive calling card.
          </p>
          <p>
            Niko "The Hybrid" Price, at 36 years old, is the definition of a crowd-pleaser. His unpredictable, chaotic fighting style guarantees excitement regardless of whether he wins or loses. While he's not championship material, Price has put together some respectable wins over his career—Randy Brown, Tim Means, Alex Oliveira, and ironically, Alex Morono all fell to him. He might not be great, but he's proven he can beat mid-tier welterweights, which is more than can be said for Veretennikov.
          </p>

          <div class="reasoning">
            <p>
              Neither guy is world-class, but Veretennikov has done absolutely nothing to suggest he can win at this level. Going 1-3 in the UFC with your only victory being a questionable split decision over a fighter on a losing streak doesn't inspire confidence. Price may be past his prime and far from elite, but he has legitimate wins on his resume. His experience and proven ability to beat UFC-caliber opponents should be enough to get past Veretennikov and pick up the decision.

            An all-Brazilian affair in the women's strawweight division features two fighters looking to crack the top 15. Bruna "The Special One" Brasil enters as a slight +130 underdog with an 11-5-1 record. While she's dropped three fights in the UFC, those losses came against solid opposition like Loma Lookboonmee and Cong Wang. More importantly, she's coming off a confidence-building win over touted prospect Ming Shi, showing she can handle rising talent.

          <p>
            Ketlen "Esquentadinha" Souza should theoretically have the edge as the -155 favorite with her 15-6 record, but there's a red flag that can't be ignored: she lost to Angela Hill in 2025. That's... not great. Hill is a respected veteran, sure, but losing to her at this stage of both fighters' careers raises serious questions about Souza's ceiling in the division. With both women looking to make their mark, this becomes a crucial proving ground.

              That Angela Hill loss really stands out as a bad sign for Souza. Meanwhile, Brasil has been fighting reasonably tough competition and just beat a prospect the UFC was excited about in Ming Shi. Brasil seems to have both momentum and experience on her side. While neither fighter is destined for title contention, I think Brasil is the more well-rounded fighter right now and should be able to outwork Souza over three rounds to take the decision.

        <h3>Javid Basharat (#48) vs. Gianni Vazquez (Unranked) - Catchweight (141 lbs)</h3>
        
        <div class="fight-overview">
          <p>
            This catchweight bout at 141 pounds is already off to a messy start. Javid Basharat enters at 14-2, fighting on the same card as his brother Farid, and desperately needs to snap a two-fight losing streak. His best UFC wins came over D'amon Blackshear and Chris Gutierrez during an impressive three-fight win streak to begin his promotional tenure. But then reality hit—he got knocked out by Ricky Simon and lost a decision to Aiemann Zahabi, forcing him to take a full year off to recover and reassess. The extended layoff raises questions about ring rust and whether the knockout has lingering effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gianni Vazquez is making his UFC debut under less-than-ideal circumstances. The 13-4-1 fighter missed weight badly, coming in at 141 pounds instead of the 135-pound bantamweight limit. To make matters worse, he took this fight on short notice, which suggests he wasn't in proper training camp mode when the call came. The UFC might be trying to develop Vazquez as a prospect to tap into the Mexican fanbase, but this is a brutal introduction to the big leagues. He's being thrown to the wolves against a fighter who, despite his recent struggles, has faced significantly stiffer competition. Basharat is installed as a massive -750 favorite for good reason.

              While that knockout loss to Simon is concerning, Basharat took a full year off to recover, which makes me think it won't factor into this fight. He's faced real competition—Simon and Zahabi are legitimate fighters. That's a level Vazquez simply hasn't experienced in his career. Add in the fact that Vazquez missed weight and took this fight on short notice, suggesting inadequate preparation, and this looks like a mismatch. Basharat should be able to impose his will wherever this fight goes, using his superior experience and skill to cruise to a decision victory and get back in the win column.

        <h3>Cong Wang (#11) vs. Eduarda Moura (#19) - Catchweight (127 lbs)</h3>
        
        <div class="fight-overview">
          <p>
            Another catchweight affair, this time in the women's flyweight division where both fighters missed weight. Cong "The Joker" Wang carries significant hype thanks to her kickboxing win over Valentina Shevchenko before joining the UFC. The 33-year-old Chinese fighter stumbled early in her promotional run with a loss to Gabriella Fernandes, but she's since reeled off a two-fight win streak and finds herself at #11 in the rankings. A victory here would move her one step closer to a title shot, though questions remain about her grappling defense.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eduarda "Ronda" Moura brings her own two-fight win streak into this contest, but she's becoming notorious for all the wrong reasons. This marks the third time Moura has missed weight since joining the UFC—a chronic issue that's starting to define her more than her fighting. At 31 years old with a 12-1 record, she has talent, but the weight-cutting problems suggest deeper issues with discipline or body composition. She's a moderate underdog at +285, and her inability to make weight isn't doing her any favors in the eyes of matchmakers or fans.

            <p>
              The blueprint to beat Wang is clear: submit her or overwhelm her with grappling. But here's the problem—Moura doesn't have the grappling credentials to pull that off. She hasn't submitted a single opponent in her entire UFC run, which tells you everything you need to know about her ground game. Wang should be able to keep this on the feet where her kickboxing pedigree gives her a significant advantage. I expect her to control the striking exchanges and pick up a decision victory, continuing her climb toward a title shot.

        <h3>Muin Gafurov (#42) vs. Jakub Wikłacz (#44) - Catchweight (141 lbs)</h3>
        
        <div class="fight-overview">
          <p>
            Yet another weight miss plagues this card, with Muin "Tajik" Gafurov failing to make the bantamweight limit and forcing this bout to 141 pounds. The 29-year-old comes in with a 20-6 record and finds himself in a virtual pick'em at -120. For a fighter who couldn't make weight, the oddsmakers aren't showing much confidence in his chances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jakub "Masa" Wikłacz, also 29, represents the fresher face in this matchup. The Polish fighter made his UFC debut back in June at UFC 316, taking the fight against Patchy Mix on short notice and pulling off the upset. That victory might be underrated—Mix didn't look sharp in his promotional debut, but beating a former Bellator champion on short notice is still impressive. Wikłacz comes in at +100, essentially even money, and looks to build on that momentum with another win over a ranked opponent.

          <div class="reasoning">
            <p>
              I think Wikłacz's win over Mix is being seriously undervalued. Yes, Mix looked off in his debut, but he's still a world-class fighter with Bellator gold on his resume. The fact that Wikłacz came in on short notice and got it done speaks volumes about his skill level. I believe we're going to see this weekend that Wikłacz is several levels above what people currently think he is. He should be able to outclass Gafurov and pick up a decision victory, proving that his debut win was no fluke.

        <h3>Priscila Cachoeira (#20) vs. Klaudia Syguła (#24)</h3>
        
        <div class="fight-overview">
          <p>
            The card closes with a women's bantamweight clash between experience and youth. Priscila "Zombie Girl" Cachoeira, at 37 years old with a 13-7 record, has seen it all during her UFC tenure. While her record shows losses, they've come against legitimate competition, and she's proven she can hang with ranked fighters. At +130, the oddsmakers see her as the underdog, but her veteran savvy shouldn't be dismissed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Klaudia Syguła represents the next generation at just 27 years old with a 7-2 record. The Polish fighter is a slight -155 favorite and comes in as a rising prospect in the bantamweight division. However, there's a concerning blemish on her resume—she was finished easily by Melissa Mullins in her UFC debut. That's her third fight in the promotion, and questions linger about whether she's actually as good as her ranking suggests or if she's been protected by favorable matchmaking.

          <div class="reasoning">
            <p>
              Cachoeira's UFC longevity speaks for itself. Yes, she has losses, but they came against strong fighters. Syguła, meanwhile, got finished rather easily by Mullins in her debut, which raises red flags about her readiness for this level of competition. I don't think Syguła is actually that good, and I believe Cachoeira is going to expose her. Look for the Brazilian veteran to get the finish and send Syguła back to the drawing board.
