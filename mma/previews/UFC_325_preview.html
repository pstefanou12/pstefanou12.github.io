      <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
      
      <p>This Saturday, the UFC returns to Sydney, Australia, for UFC 325, marking their second card of 2026, second PLE (premier live event) of the year, and second event on Paramount Plus in two weeks. The event is headlined by <strong>Alexander Volkanovski</strong> vs. <strong>Diego Lopes</strong> as <strong>Volkanovski</strong> looks to secure his first title defense in his second reign as UFC featherweight champion.</p><br>
      
      <p>The rest of the card is fairly weak, but some notable matchups include <strong>Dan Hooker</strong> vs. <strong>Benoit St Denis</strong> in the co-main event and <strong>Rafael Fiziev</strong> vs. <strong>Mauricio Ruffy</strong> in the feature bout. The main card is rounded out by <strong>Tai Tuivasa</strong> vs. <strong>Tallison Teixeira</strong>, where <strong>Tuivasa</strong> desperately needs to get back in the win column, and <strong>Quillian Salkilld</strong> vs. <strong>Jamie Mullarkey</strong>, with <strong>Salkilld</strong> coming off a brutal first-round head kick knockout win against <strong>Nasrat Haqparast</strong> at UFC 321.</p><br>
      
      <p>Notably on the prelims, <strong>Torrez Finney</strong> returns for his second UFC outing. Currently 11-0, <strong>Finney</strong>'s lackluster performance against <strong>Robert Valentin</strong> last April raises concerns about his position in the organization. <strong>Finney</strong> has an opportunity this weekend to turn the tide and show the MMA community he's more than just a lay-and-pray grappler—that he has submissions or striking in his arsenal.</p><br>
      
      <p><strong>Oban Elliott</strong> takes on <strong>Jonathan Micallef</strong> and looks to get back on track after dropping a disappointing decision to <strong>Ko Seok-hyeon</strong> in June. The early prelims also feature the final fights from the Road to UFC Season 4 finale. While not the most high-profile matchups, there should be enough entertainment to satiate fans' appetites this weekend.</p><br>
      
      <p>On another note, this card will be the last PLE fans get for some time, as the foreseeable future is packed with fight nights until UFC 326, headlined by <strong>Oliveira</strong> vs. <strong>Holloway</strong> on March 7th in Las Vegas. So for casual and hardcore fans alike, strap in for another stretch of less-than-ideal matchups.</p><br>

      <h3 id="volkVsDiego">Is Volk vs. Diego the Fight to Make?</h3>
      
      <p>Many tout <strong>Alexander Volkanovski</strong> as the greatest featherweight of all time, with three wins over <strong>Max Holloway</strong>, a win over <strong>Jose Aldo</strong>, and a close decision against one of the greatest fighters of all time, <strong>Islam Makhachev</strong>. Still, <strong>Volkanovski</strong> has battled adversity over the past couple of years after suffering a devastating first-round KO loss to <strong>Makhachev</strong> on short notice at UFC 294 in October 2023. Not long after, he lost his belt to <strong>Ilia Topuria</strong> via another devastating knockout and took a well-deserved layoff before returning to reclaim his title against <strong>Diego Lopes</strong> last year at UFC 314. The two men face off again this weekend in Sydney.</p><br>
      
      <p>Here are my overall thoughts on the rematch. First, should <strong>Diego</strong> be fighting for UFC gold again? I don't think so. His first loss to <strong>Volkanovski</strong> was a fairly one-sided decision where it became clear that <strong>Volkanovski</strong>'s overall fight IQ was much higher than <strong>Lopes</strong>'s, and <strong>Lopes</strong>'s only real chance of winning was a knockout. Since then, <strong>Volkanovski</strong> has been on the shelf, but <strong>Diego</strong> got back into the octagon at UFC Noche and scored a spectacular knockout win over <strong>Jean Silva</strong>. With two undefeated contenders—<strong>Lerone Murphy</strong> and <strong>Movsar Evloev</strong>—waiting in the wings, I don't think <strong>Diego</strong> has earned another title shot against <strong>Volkanovski</strong>. I'd go as far as to say that <strong>Youssef Zalal</strong> is more deserving than <strong>Diego</strong> with his current five-fight win streak.</p><br>
      
      <p>I'm not saying I'm not a <strong>Diego Lopes</strong> fan—I think his fights are cinema—but it feels like the top fighters in the sport are getting slighted a bit too much lately. <strong>Sean O'Malley</strong> recently received an unwarranted rematch title shot against <strong>Merab Dvalishvili</strong>. Just last week, we watched <strong>Justin Gaethje</strong> vs. <strong>Paddy Pimblett</strong> fight for the interim title while <strong>Arman Tsarukyan</strong> sat on the sidelines.</p><br>
      
      <p>The UFC is starting to steer drastically into the "entertainment" aspect of fighting and forgetting that this is ultimately a sport. Recently, Dana has been promoting Zuffa Boxing, talking about how "everyone in boxing is undefeated and that means nothing. In Zuffa, the best will fight the best." Well, if Zuffa goes down the same path as the UFC, records and win streaks will mean absolutely nothing. For a fighter to go on a one-fight win streak after being dominated by the current champ and be rewarded with a title fight is nonsense. Undefeated records may mean nothing in modern-day boxing, but win streaks and records are becoming inconsequential in MMA.</p><br>
      
      <p>I think my major gripe about this matchup is that it's a lose-lose situation for both <strong>Volkanovski</strong>'s legacy and his standing in the sport. <strong>Volkanovski</strong> is 37 years old, and I'd say he has two years max left in the sport. Regardless, I think much of it is conditional on his performance. If <strong>Volkanovski</strong> loses anytime in the next two years, I'd say he hangs it up. So, what does <strong>Volkanovski</strong> get by winning this fight? If he loses, will he get a rematch against <strong>Lopes</strong> immediately? I doubt it. They'll say he was not a long-reigning champion and is not worthy of an immediate title fight rematch. Moreover, if he wins, his legacy will show two consecutive wins over <strong>Diego Lopes</strong>, which will look odd when looking back on his career. I truly think <strong>Volkanovski</strong>'s management dropped the ball on this. There were enough other contenders that they could have pushed back on this fight. Overall, this matchmaking makes little to no sense.</p><br>
      
      <p>As far as the fight goes, I think <strong>Diego</strong> will have to come out "guns ablaze" because I don't think he has any other chance besides going for the knockout. <strong>Volkanovski</strong>, on the other hand, will have the fanbase behind him and many other paths to victory. He can easily outpoint <strong>Diego</strong> or retire the Mexican with ground and pound. Something else to note is that with the fans on his side, every single time <strong>Volkanovski</strong> connects with <strong>Diego</strong>, there will be a big rise from the crowd. Regardless of whether it's a serious blow or if <strong>Lopes</strong> rolls with the punch, the strike will seem much more significant from cageside.</p><br>
      
      <p>I think I speak on behalf of all MMA fans that it would be a travesty to see <strong>Volkanovski</strong> lose this weekend in front of his home crowd.</p><br>

      <h3 id="dan-hooker">Dan Hooker is Back!</h3>
      
      <p>After suffering a submission loss to <strong>Arman Tsarukyan</strong> in November, <strong>Dan Hooker</strong> is back to fight <strong>Benoit St Denis</strong> and get back on track. On the other hand, <strong>BSD</strong> is looking to continue his career resurgence, having rattled off three dominant wins in 2025 after a disappointing 2024. A win for either fighter will put them in a position to challenge for a matchup with a top-five contender and potentially earn a title shot.</p><br>
      
      <p>As far as who has the upper hand, I'm torn. <strong>Dan Hooker</strong> has historically struggled against grapplers in his career. In particular, thinking back to both the <strong>Tsarukyan</strong> and <strong>Makhachev</strong> fights, both matchups were one-way traffic where <strong>Hooker</strong> was effectively blanketed. <strong>BSD</strong> has strong grappling in his toolbox, and I don't know whether <strong>Hooker</strong> will have a response for it. On the other hand, St Denis is the definition of streaky. After losing to <strong>Moicano</strong> at UFC Paris in 2024, I didn't think <strong>BSD</strong> would ever win a fight again in his career. Yet here we are with <strong>BSD</strong> on a five-fight win streak.</p><br>
      
      <p>A lot of questions will be answered this weekend in this matchup. Does <strong>Hooker</strong> still have the tenacity and grit to compete with the best lightweights in the world? Has <strong>BSD</strong> reached his ceiling in the sport, or is this the best he'll ever be? We'll have to tune in to find out.</p>

            <h3 id="ruffy">Ruffy Left Fighting Nerds, but He's Back in the Octagon</h3>
      
      <p>After suffering a submission loss to <strong>Benoit St Denis</strong> at UFC Paris in September, <strong>Ruffy</strong> is back to get on track. After losing to <strong>BSD</strong>, <strong>Ruffy</strong> decided he needed a change in his training environment and notably left the "Fighting Nerds" gym in Brazil to train with <strong>Alexander Volkanovski</strong> at Freestyle Fighting in Australia. On the other hand, <strong>Rafael Fiziev</strong> made his way back to the octagon last year after recovering from an ACL injury. He went 1-1 on the year, losing to <strong>Justin Gaethje</strong> at UFC 313 on short notice and then bouncing back with a win over <strong>Ignacio Bahamondes</strong> at UFC Baku in June.</p><br>
      
      <p>I think it's clear the UFC is trying to push <strong>Ruffy</strong> very heavily. After winning knockout of the year for his knockout over <strong>Bobby Green</strong> at UFC 313, the UFC has been foaming at the mouth to get <strong>Ruffy</strong> into title contention with unwarranted matchups up the rankings. Let's not forget that before the <strong>Bobby Green</strong> fight, <strong>Ruffy</strong> had only two wins on his UFC resume over <strong>James Llontop</strong> and <strong>Jamie Mullarkey</strong>. The <strong>Llontop</strong> win was nothing to write home about, and <strong>Llontop</strong> is no longer in the UFC. It's entirely possible that <strong>Ruffy</strong> is nothing more than an overhyped can crusher, and it seems unfair that he gets another shot up the rankings after losing to <strong>BSD</strong> so one-sidedly.</p><br>
      
      <p><strong>Fiziev</strong> is another fighter the UFC has been high on for some time. Having been given two matchups against <strong>Gaethje</strong> in which he fell short twice, it's time for <strong>Fiziev</strong> to solidify himself as a top contender within the lightweight division. <strong>Fiziev</strong> is 32 years old and should be in the prime of his career.</p><br>
      
      <p>This matchup should be a striker's delight and will have serious implications within the lightweight division.</p>


      <h3 id="taiTuivasaSituation">The Tai Tuivasa Situation</h3>
      
      <p>After getting a career-changing knockout win over <strong>Derrick Lewis</strong> at UFC 271 in February 2022, <strong>Tuivasa</strong> is a prime example of a fighter who was pushed too far too fast. Since that win, <strong>Tuivasa</strong> has not been able to get it done in the octagon and is currently riding a five-fight losing streak against the top of the UFC heavyweight division. No one in the sport enjoys watching any fighter go on devastating losing streaks, and this weekend has to be a sink-or-swim situation for <strong>Tai Tuivasa</strong>. Win and live to fight another day. Lose, and I can't imagine the UFC will keep him around.</p><br>
      
      <p>Unfortunately for <strong>Tai Tuivasa</strong>, it feels like the UFC is trying to build <strong>Tallison Teixeira</strong> on top of the <strong>Tai Tuivasa</strong> brand name. <strong>Teixeira</strong> is a 26-year-old 8-1 prospect who has both a height and reach advantage over <strong>Tuivasa</strong>.</p><br>
      
      <p>Coming into this fight, it looks like <strong>Tuivasa</strong> has put some serious work in at camp and looks to be coming into this fight in the best shape of his life, but I don't think it will matter. I don't think Tai has the athleticism or the physique to be a premier heavyweight within the UFC. With the exception of the <strong>Rozenstruik</strong> loss, his recent losses have come from people who are either more imposing than him or more athletic. Given that, I don't think being in better shape is the missing piece in <strong>Tuivasa</strong>'s game. I think he would need to take years to develop a much stronger grappling game and avoid slugging on the feet, and I don't think that will happen. I'd like to be proven wrong, but I think this will be a retirement bout for <strong>Tuivasa</strong>.</p>


      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
      
      <p>As I mentioned in the introduction, this will be the last major UFC event for some time, and still it's rather lackluster. The UFC is not off to a hot start in the Paramount era and needs to get some big matchups back on the schedule to get back on track. Looking at the silver lining, there are some big fights this weekend with serious stakes. Tune in to see what happens!</p>
